        <p>Paint the Inside (Or if the Pumpkin you are using is real, Decorate the inside!) Choose your base color for the interior of the pumpkin.

DIY Pumpkin Diorama. Supplies: Large pumpkin Black paint Halloween decorations/Lemax graveyard gate 1 inch thick Styrofoam block moss hot glue bats.

To make a pumpkin diorama using a real pumpkin, cut a large round or oval opening on the front of your pumpkin. Remove all of the pumpkin guts and clean well. Follow the step-by-step tutorial below. Step 1. Add the Spanish moss to the pumpkin. Start by placing a layer of Spanish moss on the bottom of your pumpkin. 
Series of videos to create a realistic Halloween themed diorama: from cemetery fences, old walls, spooky looking statues, crooked trees and more. 
Cut a piece of cardboard and cover it with fake grass (purchased from Dollarama in craft section) and put it in the base of the pumpkin. This makes a flat, level surface to stand things on. You could also use scrap fabric, carpet or dirt instead of grass. Put everything where you want it, and then hot glue it in place.

How to Make a Halloween Pumpkin Diorama. Begin by cutting a hole in one side of your craft pumpkin with a craft knife and painting the inside a soft grey-blue color. We wanted our paper scene to be clearly visible, so we made a little hill using air drying clay — perfect for our spooky house and bare bone trees to sit upon. 
Halloween Diorama Clock: &amp;nbsp; In this project I have some Halloween characters attached to the hands of a clock traveling in a circle creating an animated Halloween diorama in a jar.&amp;nbsp; A ghost is attached to the second hand traveling in a circle at a rate of once a mi 
Appendages at this stage will improve your diorama realism. Some of the things that can be done are painting of small details, painting or applying weathering. effects, and application of decals. Techniques: Subtle painting can be best done with fine brushes. Add rust or dirt for the appropriate effect of the weathering process of the surfaces. 
Make a spooky Halloween diorama using items around the house and thrift store treasures. I’ve been scouting for vintage Halloween items to decorate my antique store booth and came across these lovely vintage witch figurines. They were only $.50 each and I thought they would be perfect in a diorama or fairy garden. 
17. Paint the Base. After the Sculptamold has fully dried, it is time to begin painting the base. To do this, use Earth-like tones of brown and grey. You can choose the colors you want but try to make the combination between them look natural. Furthermore, try to use tones of brown that are similar to the tone of your artificial dirt texture.

Once the spray paint dries, you will need to go back over the entire stone in regular black matte acrylic exterior paint to completely cover the stone in black. You may have to dab black paint into spots of foam along the edges, sides, and inside your engraved areas. *Note - Some other makers will skip the spray paint step altogether. 
By using glue dots, we can use the miniatures after Halloween in my daughter’s doll house, and then we can use them in a whole different pumpkin diorama next Halloween! I twisted string around some miniature skeletons’ necks, added a dot of glue, then hung them to the trees to add more spookiness to my haunted forest picnic scene. 
DIY Peeps-O-Lantern: Oh yeah, Halloween candy just met up with Halloween decor, and the result is awesome. The kids will love setting up this diorama with Peeps ghosts and pumpkins, although there’s no guarantee this scene will last all the way to Halloween. (via Lolly Jane) 
Step 5 – Painting the terrain. Now I wait for the CelluClay to dry completely. Since Celluclay sucks up a lot of paint I usually give it a quick cote of varnish to seal it. After this has dried it’s time to paint the base in the shades of dirt and sand you want. The base coats need only to be ”generic” earth colors like brown, walnut

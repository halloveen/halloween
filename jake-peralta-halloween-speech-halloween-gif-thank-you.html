        <p>It’s the fourth annual Halloween Heist in the 99th precinct and Jake Peralta, Captain Raymond Holt and Amy Santiago, with the help of the rest of the squad, compete for the “ 
But seriously, you guys, I just want to say, I freaking love you losers. Happy Halloween. Correct this quote. 4. Quote from Jake. Jake: Time is running out. We got to stop playing by the rules and start playing dirty. Follow my lead, Bill. Bill: Okay, but first I should tell you my safe word is "cabbage". 
&lt; Halloween Precinct on Halloween crowd cheering "Whoa, whoa, whoa."  Jake: My speech did not inspire them.  [Sighs] Attention, everyone. Jake Peralta is an  
Holt: Jake Peralta is an amazing detective/genius. [Back in the present] Jake: But now it's time for round two of our Halloween bet. This year I believe I'll make things more difficult for myself. Let's say, what, I'll steal the watch right off your wrist. 
You’re A Fireman, You Should Know How To Treat That Burn." When Boone, the Fire Marshal, arrives at a crime scene to claim that it is in his jurisdiction, Jake immediately gets defensive. This is because The New York Police Department and New York Fire Department are well-known enemies throughout the whole series. 
From Gina’s queen-like attitude to Jake’s poorly timed jokes and Captain Holt’s deadpan humor, B99 has produced plenty of memorable quotes, as well. Check them out for yourself. 1. Following  
Jake: Yes! I have a question! Captain Jeffords, are you ready for the Halloween Heist? Sergeant Jeffords: What are you doing, Peralta? Last year was the final heist. We all agreed it was over. Jake: Ah, Terry, you jolly simpleton. That was obviously a ruse. 
Jacob Jeffrey "Jake" Peralta (portrayed by Andy Samberg) is the main protagonist of the show, and the only character besides Raymond Holt to appear in every episode. At the start of the series, he was a cocky and immature, but very talented and dedicated NYPD detective stationed in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct. He was often the one coming up with precinct competitions and shenanigans and not  
Halloween may be a time to embrace candy and costumes for some, but for the detectives on the show, the holiday is all about who will be the next winner of the Halloween heist. Since Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) first challenged Captain Holt (Andre Braugher) to a contest of wits in season 1, episode 6, "Halloween," members of the 99th precinct  
Every year, the 99th Precinct has their annual Halloween Heist to decide who is the Ultimate Detective/Genius (Season 1-3), and later the Ultimate Human/Genius (Seasons 4-8). Jake attempts to take Holt's Medal of Valour from his office before midnight. Jake tries to steal the Medal of Valour from Holt's office while he is at his meeting, Holt hears Jake hiding in the ceiling and moves his  
[We start off with Jake Peralta walking out of a car. We hear his voice-over while he ducks over some tape, heading inside what seems to be a store.] JAKE:[Dramatically] This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore. I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them. I am them. AMY: Hey! What are you doing, weirdo? [The camera pans  
"Halloween II" is the 4th episode of Season Two and 26th overall of the FOX television show Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It originally aired 19th October 2014 to 5.23 million viewers. The Peralta and Holt annual Halloween bet continues when Jake challenges the Captain that he can steal his watch before midnight. Meanwhile, Gina is upset that her dance team, Floorgasm, kicks her off the squad and Terry  
Dress up as Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) So I started out having reservations about this show because I was afraid Jake Peralta would be this bungling, incompetent cop with a lot of slapstick moves. Turns out he’s a very smart cop with a very childish behavior that makes for great comedy! 
"Halloween II" is the fourth episode of the second season of the American television police sitcom series Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It is the 26th overall episode of the series and is written by consulting producer Prentice Penny and directed by Eric Appel.

The heist double-crosses have been one of the best running gags in the show, so it was only fitting they would be part of the Brooklyn 99 ending.Each intricate deception has been executed purely with the intent of victory in "The Last Day", but the final Brooklyn 99 episode's multitude of betrayals features several alternate motivations. 
The Halloween Heists of Brooklyn Nine-Nine were some of the absolute highlights of the show's eight-season run. This tradition started with a simple episode: Jake Peralta challenges Holt to a bet  
Jake &amp; Amy Season 5, Episode 22 - Aired May 20, 2018 . Jake and Amy's wedding day is majorly threatened, and Charles and the whole squad rush to help save it. Amidst the chaos, Holt hesitates to open the email that will indicate if he has won his campaign for Commissioner, despite Gina's encouragement.

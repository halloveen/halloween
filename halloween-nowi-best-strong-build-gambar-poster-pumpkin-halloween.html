I use a +10 Nowi very frequently and she’s one of my hard carries in Light Season of AR and regular game content.

Not a fan of Nowi's outfit, but I like her variant and I think her halloween form is relatively well-done. Hopefully the artist does more. And on the subject of respecting others' opinions, I was essentially told that I couldn't like Henry because he was an Awakening character whose type was locked to a seasonal banner. 
6 days ago ·  The best IVs for Corrin (F) are +Atk and -HP. Corrin's Atk stat is low pretty low for a player phase unit, so an +Atk IV would help make up for this lack of offensive power.

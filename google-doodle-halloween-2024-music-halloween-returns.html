It seemed like a good opportunity for a cat hero, since the winner of last yearâ€™s Candy Cup Doodle was Yellow Witch and her black cat. The original concept for the game involved a magic cat making a soup that was so good, it raised the dead. Connecting soup to Halloween proved too abstract, so the team shifted to the idea of a wizard school.

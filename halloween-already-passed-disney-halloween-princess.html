        <p>A child would be more likely to mention a talking skeleton than a sacred bonfire when discussing the origin of Halloween. Stacker compiled a list of ways that Halloween has changed over the last 100 years, from how we celebrate it on the day to the costumes we wear trick-or-treating. We've included events, inventions, and trends that changed  
All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween as it is commonly referred, is a global celebration on October 31. It developed from the ancient Celtic ritual of Samhain, which was, in the simplest terms, a festival celebrating the changing of the seasons from light to dark (summer to winter). This would usually take place around November 1. 
The most infamous case took place on October 31, 1974. That‚Äôs when a Texas man named Ronald O‚ÄôBryan gave cyanide-laced pixie sticks to five children, including his son. The other children  
Halloween‚Äôs origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and  
Halloween is usually celebrated amongst family, friends and, sometimes, co-workers. However, some areas hold large community events.

The observance evolved from ancient rituals marking the transition from summer to winter, thereby associating it with transformation, which is still a central theme of the holiday. 
Enchanting Etymology. Before jumping into the ancient holiday's history, it's helpful to start with the basics and learn the origins of its name. The word Halloween has evolved from Hallowe'en. In turn, this whimsical word is shorthand for ‚Äúhallowed evening,‚Äù and refers specifically to All Hallows' Eve. All Hallows' Eve is a celebration  
Roughly 2,000 years ago, the ancient Celts began celebrating Samhain to scare away the spirits. They associated the seasonal transition with darkness, cold, and death. The Halloween colors orange and black can be traced back to this time when black was associated with death and orange symbolized the fall harvest. 
Of course, Halloween didn‚Äôt originate in the U.S. Though it‚Äôs hard to be certain about its roots, scholars have a general sense of its history. As described in a classic 1990 research paper by Russell Belk, who studies consumer culture at York University in Toronto, the holiday can be traced back to the Samhain festival (meaning ‚Äúsummer‚Äôs end‚Äù) among the Celts, a people who first

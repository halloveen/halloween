        <p>There's a familiar face working for Laurie Strode at the Hillcrest Academy in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later - Jamie Lee Curtis' real-life mother, Janet Leigh! The screen legend and star of Psycho appears briefly as Strode's secretary, Norma, in a cameo that earns big laughs as a meta commentary on the horror genre. 
Box office. $75 million [ 4 ] Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later is a 1998 American slasher film directed by Steve Miner, and starring Jamie Lee Curtis, LL Cool J, Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, Janet Leigh, and Josh Hartnett in his film debut. It is the seventh installment in the Halloween franchise. H20 is a direct sequel to 1978's Halloween  
The 1957 Ford sedan that Norma drives is the same car that Janet Leigh drives in Psycho. Many found the title of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later to be somewhat odd, if not redundant, particularly making them think of the molecular composition of water. Interestingly enough, pure water has a pH of 7 and Halloween H20 is the seventh entry in the  
Halloween: H20. 91 minutes ‧ R ‧ 1998. Roger Ebert. August 5, 1998. 3 min read. Notes jotted down while watching “Halloween: H20”: Medical science should study Michael Myers, the monster who has made the last two decades a living hell for Laurie Strode. Here is a man who feels no pain. He can take a licking and keep on slicing. 
Interestingly, Janet Leigh's cameo in Halloween H20 doubles down on its meta qualities. The name of Janet Leigh's character, Norma, is an obvious reference to Norman Bates, the iconic killer from Psycho. On top of that, Janet Leigh's final scene in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later sees her 
Leigh would appear opposite her daughter once again in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), playing the secretary of Laurie Strode. [80] On television, Leigh acted in the Murder, She Wrote episode "Doom with a View" (1987), as Barbara LeMay in an episode of The Twilight Zone ("Rendezvous in a dark place", 1989) and the Touched by an Angel  
Janet Leigh, to horror fans, is best known as Marion Crane from Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. The infamous shower scene is regarded as one of the most terrifying in film. H20 Director Steve Minor payed homage to her character in Halloween H20 by using a replica of the car she drove in Psycho. 
Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of Psycho star Janet Leigh, was cast in Halloween as a nod to her mother's iconic role. The Halloween franchise, particularly in H20 , features Easter eggs and  
Halloween H20: 20 Years Later: Directed by Steve Miner. With Jamie Lee Curtis, Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, Adam Hann-Byrd. Laurie Strode, now the dean of a Northern California private school with an assumed name, must battle the Shape one last time, as the life of her own son hangs in the balance. 
4. Janet Leigh's Cameo. Straight-up, Janet Leigh is a legend. She of course immortalised Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and just so happens to be the mother of another badass woman who  
Janet Leigh, who plays Norma, played Marion in Psycho. The license plate on the car is also the same as the second car Marion buys in Psycho, NFB 418, which are Norman Bates' initials and lastly, Norma is the first name of Norman Bates' Mother from Psycho. 
In the 1970s she appeared on the small screen in a number of made-for-TV movies. In 1980, she appeared alongside her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis in The Fog (1980), and later, in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998). Janet Leigh died at age 77 in her home in Beverly Hills, California on October 3, 2004. 
Soles also played Lynda in the original Halloween. There is also a cameo by Janet Leigh, mother of Jamie Lee Curtis and star of Psycho, which is the Spiritual Ancestor to the original Halloween. Janet Leigh drives the car she drove in Psycho, and her scene is scored with the music from that film.

I want too say as a horror fan and I have just recently discovered the Halloween franchise Halloween H20 is the movie twenty Years after the events of Halloween night 1978 where 16 Year old Laurie Strode is then just a school girl who has escaped a man who was her not known brother it starts off with the Micheal Myers, who has been missing for  
Two decades after surviving a massacre on October 31, 1978, former baby sitter Laurie Strode finds herself hunted by persistent knife-wielder Michael Myers. Laurie now lives in Northern California under an assumed name, where she works as the headmistress of a private school. But it's not far enough to escape Myers, who soon discovers her whereabouts.

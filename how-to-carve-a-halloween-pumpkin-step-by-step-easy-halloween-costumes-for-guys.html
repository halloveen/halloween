        <p>Start cutting. Using the sharpest knife in the house, carefully cut along your design, making sure the hand that's stabilizing the pumpkin is not in the path of the hand wielding the knife. If a piece you've cut doesn't pop out, try pushing it in. (You can retrieve it through the entry hole in back.) 
When you're ready to carve, rinse off the pumpkin and use a sturdy knife to cut an opening in the bottom or top. If you go for the top, Scott recommends cutting a round opening with a triangular notch. "Without a notch, it can be hard to fit the lid back in when you're done," Scott says. Then, start scraping. 
Draw a circle with about a 2 in (5.1 cm) radius from the stem with a washable marker. Tilt the blade at a 45-degree angle toward the stem and push it into the pumpkin. Saw along your outline with the knife until you can pull the lid off. [2] Cutting at an angle prevents the lid from falling inside of your pumpkin.

Cut a Hole. Start by taking your long kitchen knife or the knife in your pumpkin carving set and saw a jagged hole either around the stem or in the back of the pumpkin. A hole in the top is best for real candles as the smoke can escape and you have a helpful handle thanks to the stem. A hole the back is easier for placing lights or faux candles.

Cut out the design: Make straight cuts into your pumpkin along the lines of your design, removing the pieces and discarding them in the refuse bowl.

Draw a circular lid around the pumpkin stem. Depending on the size of your pumpkin, your lid should be around 12-15cm in diameter. Remember it needs to be big enough for you to be able to get your hand in to rummage around. Using a small knife with a serrated blade, start cutting into the pumpkin following the line of the lid. 
To extend the life of your carving, choose an unblemished pumpkin from the patch and carve it right away. Then create a spray using 1 tablespoon of Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap, 6 drops of peppermint oil, and 8 ounces of water; spray the mixture on the inside and outside of the carved pumpkin.

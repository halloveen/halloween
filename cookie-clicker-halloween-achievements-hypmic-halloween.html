For achievements in beta versions, see Cookie Clicker Beta. Achievements are badges you earn for achieving certain goals, and each one increases the amount of milk you have (except shadow achievements). They were introduced in version 1.026. As of version 2.052, there are 622 normal achievements and 17 shadow achievements, totaling 639 achievements. Additionally, there are four dungeon

Seasons are events that unlock special upgrades and achievements, and alter gameplay. They can be helpful to get achievements that can only be earned in the first run or through Challenge Mode, such as True Neverclick or Speed baking III. The first season introduced was Halloween Season in October 2013, followed by Christmas Season in December 2013, Valentine's Day Season in February 2014  
Halloween Season: Oct. 24th - Oct. 31st. Christmas Season: Dec. 15th - Dec. 31st. Another way for players to access these seasonal events outside of their scheduled appearance is through the prestige mechanic in Cookie Clicker. After the player has baked 1 trillion cookies, they may use the Legacy button to reset their progress and ascend. 
To obtain Halloween cookies in Cookie Clicker, follow these steps: 1. Unlock Halloween cookies by meeting specific requirements, typically reaching a specific level or milestone in the game. 2. Click on the Halloween-themed golden cookies that randomly appear on the screen to obtain Halloween cookies. 
According to the Cookie Clicker Wiki: Valentine's Day is February 10-15 Easter is Palm Sunday-Resurrection Sunday (exact dates depend on the year, and I believe this follows Catholic Easter like most of the world, not Orthodox) Halloween is October 24-31 Christmas is December 15-31 Business Day (no related achievements) is March 31-April 2 
The Halloween season in Cookie Clicker unlocks special upgrades, achievements, and alters gameplay. It was introduced in October 2013 and can be triggered automatically for a defined period of time around the Halloween holiday. The “Season Switcher” upgrade allows players to change seasons at will for 24 hours. 
The "cookie clicker forever and forever a hundred years cookie clicker, all day long forever, forever a hundred times, over and over cookie clicker adventures dot com" achievement is a reference to Rick and Morty, a popular show on Adult Swim. This is in reference to episode 1, at the end. 
The ascension screen is accessed by the Legacy button, which is under the Info button. Although you can ascend as early as you want, it will not give any benefit until you have baked enough cookies. Depending on how many cookies you have baked, you will earn Heavenly Chips and Prestige Levels when ascending (at a 1:1 ratio). Heavenly Chips are used in the Ascension screen to purchase Heavenly

The unlock rate is 5% base and up to 91% depending on achievements, upgrades, dragon auras, heavenly upgrades, pantheon gods, garden plants, and wrinkler type (normal or shiny). 
Achievements in Cookie Clicker were introduced in version 1.026, and their numbers have grown since. As of now, in version 2.048, there are 569 Normal achievements and 16 Shadow achievements, which sums up to 585 in total. Unlike other games, achievements here are not just for show as they unlock new Milk types.

The Grandmapocalypse is an in-game event that affects both the 1.0 Update of the game, as well as the pre-update version. It affects the background as well as the appearance of the game window and causes spawning of Wrinklers and Wrath cookies. Once "One Mind" is purchased, the Grandmapocalypse begins. The Grandmas are now considered "Awoken" and the Grandmatriarch Status will change to Awoken  
Seasons are events in Cookie Clicker that are based on holidays and give upgrades (usually as random drops), have unique achievements, and have special effects while staying in those seasons. Seasons will be triggered at certain times based on the system's clock, or forced through the season switcher.

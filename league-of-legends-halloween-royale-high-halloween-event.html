Fright Night is one of the most unique Halloween-themed skin lines we have received in League of Legends. It initially started as one of the oldest skin lines in the game, Gothic. That universe contained skins like Goth Annie, Emumu, and Gothic Orianna. But after the Orianna skin, they retired this skin line in favor of more unique skin lines.

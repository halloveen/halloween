After compiling my thoughts, I’ve created my official rankings for the ten houses of Halloween Horror Nights 33. Warning: spoilers ahead! Halloween Horror Nights 2024 Haunted House Ranking 10. Major Sweet’s Candy Factory. It seemed many people were excited for this one, as the Major Sweet’s character has been in HHN lore for some time.

It’s that time again! Halloween Horror Nights has kicked off their 2024 event at Universal Studios Hollywood! Hollywood has been on a hot streak since coming back from the COVID shutdown in 2020, featuring some of the best haunted houses in recent years, including original features like La Llorona, Monstruos, and Scarecrow: The Reaping. 
Eternal Bloodlines — 8/10. This house is a first-of-its-kind all-female Universal Monsters house. Universal said that guests will “Get caught in an epic battle as Saskia Van Helsing and the Bride of Frankenstein go up against Dracula’s daughter and her monstrous mavens.”

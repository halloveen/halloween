Rob Zombie’s Halloween (2007) remains one of the most widely, and viciously, despised remakes of all time – despite how The Thing (2011) threw out its finely-tuned practical effects in favor of shoddy CGI, and Child’s Play (2019) made Chucky a sad sack loser whose whimpers echoed from the closet in which he was far too easily trapped by loser-pants Andy.

Of this run of redos, Zack Synder's Dawn Of The Dead is arguably the best. However, Rob Zombie's Halloween might rank as the most divisive. The idea of remaking John Carpenter's Halloween - a movie that essentially gave birth to the slasher movie as it currently exists - was already considered sacrilege.

In the 15 years since Rob Zombie released his updated take on John Carpenter’s 1978 classic Halloween (released on October 31, 2007), Zombie has cemented his position as a major horror filmmaker  
From acclaimed musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie comes an entirely new take on the highly successful and terrifying Halloween legacy, which began in 1978. While revealing a new chapter in the established Michael Myers saga, the film will surprise both classic and modern horror fans with a departure from prior films in the Halloween franchise.

Starring: Scout Taylor-Compton Malcolm McDowell Tyler Mane William Forsythe Danny Trejo. Directed by: Rob Zombie. Rob Zombie's Halloween.

After being committed for 17 years, Michael Myers, now a grown man and still very dangerous, escapes from the mental institution (where he was committed as a 10 year old) and he immediately returns to Haddonfield, where he wants to find his baby sister, Laurie. 
Rob Zombie Halloween was my favorite movie when I was younger (It came out when I was in maybe 7th grade). As an adult I can absolutely see the flaws and don’t think it touches the original at all. That being said it’s still got some of my favorite kills in the franchise, I think the absolute best Michael look, and Malcolm McDowell’s

Rob Zombie's first Halloween is overly vulgar (the dialogue feels like it was written by an edgy 12 yo) and robs Michael of the mystique he had in the original Halloween, but I still find it enjoyable none the less. Halloween 2 is trash. It turns Laurie &amp; Dr. Loomis into the most unlikable a**holes you could possibly imagine.

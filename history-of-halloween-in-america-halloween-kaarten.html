Halloween traditions in the West date back thousands of years to the festival of Samhain (pronounced 'Soo-when', 'So-ween' or 'Saw-wen'), the Celtic New Year's festival. The name means "summer's end", and the festival marked the close of the harvest season and the coming of winter.

Halloween festivities as we know them today in the United States are a very recent invention. Before the twentieth century, folks had little inclination or incentive to hand out sweet treats to costumed youth, with All Hallows’ Eve largely understood as a vaguely creepy pan-cultural pagan holdover invoking the fall festival of Samhain. 
The history of Halloween in America is a tale of evolution and adaptation. What began as an ancient Celtic festival has transformed into a uniquely American celebration characterized by costumes, candy, and community. 
How did Halloween become an American holiday? The Halloween that you know today is a result of the great American immigrant melting pot. At first, celebrations were pretty limited in colonial New England as the Puritans weren't on board with the holiday's pagan roots. Because of this, Halloween was more common in Maryland and the southern colonies. 
Places like Anoka in Minnesota, the self-proclaimed "Halloween capital of the world," paved the way for this. In Anoka, the first official Halloween celebrations of the USA took place in 1920. Scary costumes became more and more popular in America from the 1930s on, and a huge market was built around Halloween products.

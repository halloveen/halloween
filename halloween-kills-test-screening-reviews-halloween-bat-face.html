        <p>Halloween Kills is directed by David Gordon Green and produced by Jason Blum, Malek Akkad, and Bill Block. David Gordon Green wrote the script with Danny McBride and Scott Teems. The music will be  
A few of the other Halloween subreddits are posting their reviews (some with spoilers some without) about the test screening last night, and apparently it's an extremely well done film, most saying way better than 2018. I'm so hype for this movie, I loved the 2018 film. I've found out some info, but not all. I'm so ready. 
A few months ago I was lucky enough to see a test screening of Halloween Kills. Iâ€™m not going to discuss plot or anything specific so I donâ€™t spoil anything. What I will tell you is movie is excellent and an absolute gem of a sequel. The violence and brutality is absolutely off the charts. This is the most brutal Michael Myers has ever been. 
Just in time for half time, I have an in-depth report from a direct source of the Halloween Kills TEST SCREENING. I break down everything I know, from the au 
Just a heads up guys and galsmy source within BH just informed me of a few things pertaining to Halloween Kills: 1: Kyle Richards and Richard Longstreet are both being asked back to Universal Studios to complete additional Automated Dialogue Replacement sessions (ADRS) in the coming weeks.

Feb 8, 2020. #1. This past Thursday night in Los Angeles, California, Blumhouseâ€™s Halloween Kills had its first test screening in front of an audience of around 200 or so moviegoers. Below, we have put together as much non-spoiler information as we can from attendees. We canâ€™t guarantee that the following user comments/reviews are 100%  
Now fans are hoping the next installment, Halloween Kills, also by Green, continues this new uptick in quality horror in the name of Michael Myers. The good news is that some of the first reviews of the sequel â€” filed after its premiere at the Venice Film Festival this week â€” are favorable. The bad news is that, overall, the reception is  
Rated R, 1 hour 46 minutes. But in this second part of a trilogy spun out of the rebooted property â€” all set on the same night and slated to conclude with next yearâ€™s Halloween Ends â€” Green  
The Wrapâ€™s Asher Luberto also left the Venice Film Festival screening with positive things to say about Halloween Kills. The critic called it an effective sequel and highlighted the movie for  
The CGI is done perfect. And officer Hawkins. He survived 2018. Michael is brutal as hell. He kills alot of people. Somewhere between 50 people. The ending is absolute balls to the walls. Michael kills almost every one from the previous movies except for Laurie, Allison, Lindsey and officer Hawkins. The 3rd act takes place at the Myers house.

Supposedly the commentaries for Halloween Kills has David Gordon Green mention that the radio tower was digitally added in certain scenes to prep for Halloween Ends. I donâ€™t know if this was back when Halloween Ends was taking place immediately after Halloween Kills, or if this was done after the decision was made to advance the story 4 years  
Just for the record. Any test screening reviews that arenâ€™t from verified hardcore Halloween fans are basically useless to listen to for people in here like us. Iâ€™ve been to a lot of test screenings. Most of them in there have no idea whatâ€™s going on 95% of the time.

Along with test screening reviews, quite a bit of information about "Halloween kills" his managed to through over the past several months. Here's everything I am managed to gather up. To anyone who doesn't want to know anything and has managed to keep themselves in the dark for this long, read no further. 
Considering the fact that the makers have made it very clear that there WILL be a follow-up (Halloween Ends) that acts as a conclusion with a smaller scale, this basically being a 90-minute rampage through the town of Haddonfield is exactly what I've been expecting and it sounds like a great time to me.

Costumed trick-or-treating takes its inspiration from the Celtic holiday Samhain —“summer’s end” in Irish—more than 2,000 years ago. Samhain marked New Year’s Day and fell around  
Trick-or-treating. Trick-or-treating is a traditional Halloween custom for children and adults in some countries. During the evening of Halloween, on October 31, people in costumes travel from house to house, asking for treats with the phrase "trick or treat". The "treat" is some form of confectionery, usually candy /sweets, although in some  
One theory suggests that excessive pranks on Halloween led to the widespread adoption of an organized, community-based trick-or-treating tradition in the 1930s. This trend was abruptly curtailed

Trick-or-treating wasn't widely popular in the United States until around 1940, writes Nicholas Roger, author of "Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night." Before then, the mischievous holiday had spiraled into an adolescent free-for-all, marked by rampant vandalism and excessive tomfoolery. 
The first recorded mentions of "trick or treat" come from 1920s newspaper accounts of Halloween in Canada, according to Merriam-Webster.

Trick-or-Treat Around the World. Trick-or-treating today is most common in the United States, with parts of Europe, Canada, and Australia following suit. For countries that don't celebrate Halloween or have trick-or-treating, there seems to be an equivalently joyous celebration in the autumn season that involves going from door to door and  
Earliest Uses of 'Trick or Treat' Still, the trick-or-treating took some time to settle in. The authority on how that term first settled into the lexicon is Barry Popik, an independent etymologist who's also uncovered the mysteries behind such culturally important terms as hot dog and Big Apple. It is he who has found the earliest known  
When I was a kid in the 80s-90s it was after dark. This was also when daylight savings ended before Halloween instead of after Halloween like it does now. Seems like the younger kids around here go while it's still light out and trick or treat time extends into a little while after dark. 
Trick-or-treat hours will be from 6-8 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 31. City officials said IMPD will be patrolling various neighborhoods on Halloween to make sure the community members celebrating the holiday are safe. Witch Way Haunted House (less spooky) - Oct. 10-31 (except Mondays) - times vary

        <h2><strong>what was halloween like in the 1800s sexy halloween costumes</strong></h2>
        <p>Halloween was also initially thought of as a quaint practice and confined to immigrant communities during the mid-1800s and thought of as being celebrated “amongst the old-style English, Irish, Scotch and Welsh residents.”[2] Furthermore, when mentions of Halloween appeared in the mid-1800s the idea of superstition and love was attached to  
Halloween in early 19th-century America was a night for pranks, tricks, illusions, and anarchy. Jack-o’-lanterns dangled from the ends of sticks, and teens jumped out from behind walls to  
In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft. At the turn of the  
In the late 1800s, common Halloween tricks included placing farmers’ wagons and livestock on barn roofs, uprooting vegetables in backyard gardens and tipping over outhouses. 
Halloween received its biggest transformation within the last 50 or so years, thanks to the creation of big candy corporations, and, of course, Hollywood. Because of its association with all things dark, spooky, and undead, Halloween became the go-to holiday for the release of most horror films and television shows. 
Check out seven Halloween traditions from the Victorian spooky season. 1. Victorians liked to try and predict their marital status on Halloween. Marriage: The scariest Halloween subject of them  
Parties and Pranks. In addition to discussions of superstition, Halloween parties and pranks thrived from East to West. Another report from Ironton, Montana, noted that “lads” could be counted upon to organize cabbage-throwing brigades, switch the undertaker’s sign board to the doctor’s office, and put a stuffed donkey at a professor’s desk or a preacher’s pulpit. 
In the 19th century, Halloween traditions and celebrations embraced a unique blend of ancient Celtic customs and emerging American cultural influences. Halloween was primarily observed as a rural community event, characterized by bonfires, costume parties, and pranks. The notion of dressing up in costumes stemmed from the belief that disguising  
According to Kelly, Halloween took root in the U.S. sometime around the 19th century, when the Irish immigrated to America, bringing their traditions and celebrations, including All Saints’ Day  
Candy had first made its appearance in the 1800s at American Halloween parties as taffy that children could pull, and candy is now solidified as the go-to “treat.” By the mid 20th century  
Halloween in the 1800s was not the candy-fueled celebration we know today. Its history stretches back to the times of Celtic druids and Roman conquests, and the foods that Victorian-era Americans enjoyed for Halloween were shaped by ancient European customs. 
In the late 1800s, since store bought wasn't really an option, people made their own costumes, focusing on the most recognizable symbols of Halloween, like witches or ghosts. Advertisement 
Across the American countryside in the latter 1800s, common Halloween tricks included placing farmers’ wagons and livestock on barn roofs, uprooting vegetables in backyard gardens and tipping  
Halloween didn’t start as the candy-fueled celebration we know today. In the mid-1800s, Irish families brought Halloween and its associated traditions with them to America. 
The Victorian era was the period in British history between about 1820 and 1914, corresponding roughly to the period of Queen Victoria’s reign (1837–1901). It was characterized by a class-based society, a growing number of people able to vote, a growing state and economy, and Britain’s status as the most powerful empire in the world. 
Invented by the Wunderle Candy Company, it’s still a best-selling Halloween candy, and will probably still be around for years to come! Other candy companies began to crop up. Reed’s Candy came along and set up business in Chicago. 
Some Halloween traditions in the 19th century: Within a few decades of the wave of Irish immigrants to the United States, Halloween celebrations grew more generally popular. We still have some of the same Halloween rituals today, although others from the 19th century might surprise you. 
As it happens, Victorian Britain was often as wrong about America as modern thinking is about the Victorians. Halloween in America during the 1800s was not unlike the Halloween described in contemporary British reports (via Mimi Matthews). Americans, too, favored games, divination, and private, respectable parties. 
Apples, burned nuts and cabbage stalks. Learn how Baltimore celebrated Halloween in the 1800s: “Tonight is All Hallowe’en, dedicated formerly by lads and lassies to lovers’ games and charms, but now degenerated into the ringing of door-bells and the hanging of cabbage stalks on door-knobs and other impish tricks by mischievous boys. 
Halloween had long been a night of revelry for adults and children, seen as a positive outlet for young men to blow off steam.  Starting in the 1800s, Marie Tussaud’s wax museum in London  </p>

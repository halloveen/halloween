        <p>The Halloween update for Dress to Impress on Roblox dropped on October 19, 2024. Along with 67 new items and a bunch of other changes. But the thing that has the Discord server hyped up is the new Lana Lore. Let me guide you through all three chapters of Lana's new quest from the DTI Halloween update. 
DTI Halloween update brings a captivating new quest to uncover new secrets for Lana's lore. The quest features three thrilling chapters, which players can access from the green portal in the Halloween lobby.

Place a pen and paper along with a “Guess How Many Candies” sign nearby. You can use jaw breakers, candy eyeballs, candy corns or any other Halloween candy in your jar. Preferably candy with a color related to your party theme. The party guest who guesses closest wins the jar and the candy to take home and eat. 
Use Halloween-themed signs to instruct guests to communal areas such as the bar, food table, bathroom, and dance floor, especially if your eerie ambiance makes navigation a challenge. 24. Stock the bar and snacks. Fully stock the bar with tasty snacks and appetizers that are prepped for serving.

So got the Halloween costumes / gallery pictures, but not having a lot of luck of unlocking / starting off things with this new guest. Tried level 1 through 5 guests to be entered, and re-rolling up to 5x  but still, no new guest. Am I missing something painfully obvious (Halloween card is equipped). 
The last thing you want is for people to put all this effort into their costumes and to have yours be rather lacking.

The sad/unfair thing is you only get 5 pokemon but the good thing is that they counter some pokemon. Some tips. Pokemon that are dying - I suggest you recall them and if HP charge is open use it. If it has enemies keep the pokes in your slots. Charges - It depends on what you choose to do - keep fighting or use a spdef charge to gain, well, spdef. 
Event Tutors. There are three tutors found in Ghoul Swamp. Each of which are classified as event tutors, meaning that they can only teach their respective moves to Pokémon that would normally learn it through events of the core games. Baton Pass Event Tutor can be found inside Abandoned House 1, which is in the top right of the map. 
Generally you can find all aviable event sprites corresponding to the event. Halloween event -&gt; All halloween sprites are catchable Winter event -&gt; All winter sprites are catchable [] And so on. To find those sprites you can take a look at our Wiki for example: Pokémon Counterparts 
During the Halloween event, Froakie found in Necropolis can potentially have the hidden ability Battle Bond. However, this ability is limited to male Froakie with the ability Protean only. Every male, Protean Froakie has a chance of being Battle Bond when evolved into a Greninja. </p>

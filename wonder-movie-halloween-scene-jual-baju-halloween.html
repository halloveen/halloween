Wonder. (film) Wonder is a 2017 American coming-of-age family comedy-drama directed by Stephen Chbosky, who co-wrote the screenplay with Steven Conrad and Jack Thorne. It is based on the 2012 novel of the same name by R. J. Palacio and stars Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Jacob Tremblay, Mandy Patinkin, and Daveed Diggs. 
Quick answer: Key moments in Wonder include August's tour of Beecher Prep, where he meets Jack Will, Charlotte, and Julian; the Halloween incident where he overhears Jack Will mocking him  
At the same time, the film never upsets the apple cart of conventionality. “Wonder” is an honest feel-good movie, but it lacks the pricklier edges of art. Auggie has been home-schooled by his

November 17, 2017. 4 min read. Based on the R.J. Palacio novel of the same name, “Wonder” follows a year in the life of August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), Auggie, for short. He was born with a genetic abnormality that has required him to undergo surgeries and medical treatments since his earliest days. Director Stephen Chbosky has managed to  
Chapter 29: Costumes. To August, Halloween is the best day of the year. He likes it even better than Christmas, mainly because on Halloween, he gets to wear a mask. 
Wonder - School Tour: Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) gets a tour around school from Jack Will (Noah Jupe), the school bully (Bryce Gheisar), and Charlotte (Elle McK 
Wonder - Two Things About Yourself: Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs) asks Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) to introduce himself to the class.BUY THE MOVIE:  
Summer's struggle to decide on a costume is indicative of the social landscape at school. Even though Summer is clearly eschewing any hopes of being popular by eating lunch with August in the first place, it's also telling that she feels the need to preserve some of her social standing by choosing a socially acceptable costume.

Summer's happiness at being invited shows that she is actually interested in being a part of the upper crust of Beecher Prep, though her comment that Savanna "looks like a teenager" suggests that this may be because Summer is interested in appearing more grown up through association more than anything else. 
Again, Julian's choice to go as Darth Sidious is clearly a jab at August given that both boys are aware of the baggage surrounding Star Wars and the character (Darth Sidious’ face burns and melts in one of the movies). Once again, the reference to Darth Sidious appears to go right over the heads of the teachers. 
She thinks that Halloween must be the best for August, since he looks like any other kid. She goes to his room in the evening to check on him and make sure he doesn't want to go to the Halloween parade.

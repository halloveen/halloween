star-scrapper. • 6 yr. ago. Knotts is a better event than USH HHN imo. The mazes are diverse and feel a lot more immersive than HHN (No black hallways), plus I think the scares are better. I like original mazes far more than IP's so I think that's a big factor for me as well.

Forget the haunted mazes, attractions, and shows. The scariest thing about Knott’s Scary Farm is the long lines! On select nights in November to October, Knott’s Berry Farm transforms into Knott’s Scary Farm — one of the most popular Halloween events in the country. With haunted houses, mazes and attractions, shows, and thrill rides  
My take: HHN is a better experience if you are only looking for superior mazes. KSF offers a more rounded experience overall. At least in 2021 scary farm was better haven’t been to horror nights this year though. HHN is only worth it if you can afford the fast lane passes in my opinion.

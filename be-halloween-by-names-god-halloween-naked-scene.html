The third meaning of hallow is from Leviticus 22:31–32, “So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the Lord. And you shall not profane my holy name, that I may be sanctified among the people of Israel.”. Obeyed be your name, is what we mean, when we say, “Hallowed be your name.”. Obeyed be your name.

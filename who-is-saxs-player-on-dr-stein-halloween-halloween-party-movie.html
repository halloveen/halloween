        <p>Dr. Stein. 1. Savage. 2. Livin ain't No Crime. " Dr. Stein " is a song by German power metal band Helloween.

Originally published in Metal Hammer 142. 
Sascha Gerstner (born 2 April 1977) is a German musician who has been one of the guitarists and backing vocalists of power metal band Helloween since 2002. As of 2016, he is Helloween's second-longest tenured guitarist, surpassing his predecessor Roland Grapow, who stayed in the band for 12 years. He is also a former member of Freedom Call.

Similarly, Dr. Stein’s creations, whether they be monsters or clones, ultimately lead to his tragic demise. In the second verse, it is revealed that Dr. Stein decides to clone himself, but his creation turns against him and ends his life with a syringe. This darker twist in the song’s storyline adds depth and complexity to the overall meaning. 
The song centers around the character of Dr. Stein, who is portrayed as a mad scientist with mysterious and sinister motives. The lyrics delve into the mind of Dr. Stein, exploring his psychological state and the experiments he conducts. The character of Dr. Stein can be seen as a representation of the dark side of human nature, the pursuit of

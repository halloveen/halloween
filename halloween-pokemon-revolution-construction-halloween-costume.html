The Pokemon itself doesn't have to be a Halloween form, but must have one. You will obtain Points based on the Pokemon's Nature &amp; Ability (depending on how beneficial they are for the Pokemon), and even more points if the Pokemon is an Halloween or Shiny form. Only Pokemon caught after October 1st 12AM GMT+0 are eligible. 
The sad/unfair thing is you only get 5 pokemon but the good thing is that they counter some pokemon. Some tips. Pokemon that are dying - I suggest you recall them and if HP charge is open use it. If it has enemies keep the pokes in your slots. Charges - It depends on what you choose to do - keep fighting or use a spdef charge to gain, well, spdef.

        <p>Instead Evangelical Christians may celebrate Reformation Day (also Oct. 31) or have a fall festival without any of the classic Halloween elements, like costumes or scary decorations. Some Hindus 
Many Christians believe that participating in Halloween is a form of involvement in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness, which is forbidden in Scripture: Ephesians 5:7–15. Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. 
Halloween can be an opportunity to exemplify these teachings, reminding us of our duty to reflect God's light, even in the most unconventional settings. Whether or not you choose to celebrate Halloween, consider how you can leverage any opportunity to advance God’s Kingdom. Use these moments to show the world Jesus in all you do. 
The word Halloween literally means the evening before All Hallows Day (or All Saint’s Day) celebrated on November 1. Halloween is also the shortened name of Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Evening and All Saint’s Eve which is celebrated on October 31. The origin and meaning of Halloween are derived from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, but  
Halloween originated as a Celtic holiday called Samhain celebrated 2,000 years ago. It marked the end of the Celtic year and the beginning of a dark, cold winter. It was said at the time that night ghosts of the dead roamed the earth. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III moved All Saints Day, a holiday to honor all the saints who did not  
While there is no Biblical response to Halloween specifically, the Bible does have a lot to say about death, darkness, and evil. And for some, Halloween is a season to reckon with these themes. Below, we have gathered 13 Bible verses to read and maybe to share too leading up to Halloween. Terri Robertson is the Senior Editor, Digital, at  
Yes, Christians can, because the blood of Christ has redeemed Halloween. Traditionally, October 31, which is named Halloween or All Hallows’ Eve, has been considered a pagan holiday. On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a  
Televangelist Pat Robertson still warns that Halloween is a day when millions of children “celebrate Satan.”. “There’s a longstanding discourse in America about ‘innocents at risk  
As believers, we are called to take the light into the darkness, not run away from it. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it” (John 1:5, NLT). Halloween is a night that is celebrated all over the world as a night that glorifies evil and desensitizes children to things that the enemy loves. 
The Origins of Halloween. Most sources trace the pre-Christian roots of Halloween to the Celtic harvest festival known as Samhain, traditionally celebrated on the last day of October into the  
Samhain’s sacrifices morphed into Halloween’s handing out a different kind of offering: candy. Nevertheless, Halloween contains roots in a pagan celebration of death and rebirth. So, should Christians really celebrate Halloween? Christians and Halloween. For many Christian communities, there are three main responses to Halloween. 
Rather than separate completely from the night’s activities, some Christians give Gospel tracts along with treats to children who come to their homes and make Halloween an opportunity to witness for Christ. Others offer safe places for lighthearted fun. Want to share the Gospel with your neighbors? 
Many Christians celebrate Halloween. Some churches and pastors even do.  The two just don't go together. Jesus has nothing in common with Satan (2 Cor. 6:14), and  
Some Christians fully participate in the traditions of the holiday, while others attend harvest parties and similar events. Others don’t do anything special at all. So why don’t some Christians observe Halloween? Some Christians don’t celebrate Halloween because of its pagan roots and its present-day associations with evil. 
Due to its decidedly pagan origins, the answer to the question as to whether Christians should celebrate Halloween is a resounding no. The answer to the question as to whether can Christians participate in Halloween activities without compromising their faith is more difficult.

Harvest Event has always been one of my favorite Halloween maps, with the calm yet slightly spooky atmosphere, it really nails that Halloween vibe for me. It has that feeling similar to the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown special, being slightly spooky, with any “scary” stuff being meant in good fun rather than to actually terrify you. 
Mann Manor is an Attack/Defend Control Point map. It is a night-time map set in and around the old, decaying mansion of Redmond Mann. It shares elements with other Halloween maps as well as having some gameplay elements that were unique to the map when it was released, such as the Horseless Headless Horsemann, a neutral boss that periodically spawns at contested points on the map and

Ghost Fort is an official King of the Hill map, released as part of the Spectral Halloween Special on October 26, 2012. One key deviation from all other King of the Hill maps is the round length. To win Ghost Fort, a team must have controlled the point for at least seven minutes, versus the usual three. 
Halloween achievements are the 28 achievements released during past Halloween Events.. Players can make progress on most Halloween achievements all year long to the extent that Community servers may host released or custom Halloween maps at any time; and necessary mechanisms for certain achievements (e.g., Crumpkins, Ghosts, Skeletons, Bosses, and pumpkin bombs) are features of the maps rather  
For the Halloween mode to function in maps other than Halloween-themed ones, the server variable tf_forced_holiday should be set to 2.

The Voodoo-Cursed Soul and green footstep Halloween Spell effect ends up wherever a spectator is currently looking, which by default is in the center of the map. These effects may also merge with the player upon changing rounds, even as a Human form. This can also obstruct first person viewmodels if they are attached to the player. 
Scream Fortress 2020 or Scream Fortress XII was the Halloween event that started October 1, 2020, with the in-game announcement of activation of the Halloween map menus and holiday-restricted cosmetics. </p>

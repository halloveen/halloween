A jack-o'-lantern (or jack o'lantern) is a carved lantern, most commonly made from a pumpkin, or formerly a root vegetable such as a mangelwurzel, rutabaga or turnip. [1] Jack-o'-lanterns are associated with the Halloween holiday. Its name comes from the phenomenon of strange lights flickering over peat bogs, called jack-o'-lanterns (also known  
"[Halloween] is supposed to be scary about imaginary things. It's not supposed to be scary about real things," Due says. "For a lot of us, that's not supernatural imagery. 
The history of racist Halloween costumes, and the progress we’ve made in saying goodbye to them. by Austa Somvichian-Clausen | Oct. 30, 2020 | Oct. 30, 2020 
Halloween is filled with tricks and treats, but it's also filled with land mines of cultural appropriation and racist tropes.  Many college campuses run campaigns on cultural sensitivities  
The answer to the question is yes. In 2019, jack-o’-lanterns painted black and trimmed with a white mouth, eyes, and nose are racist, at least to some people. It’s blackface. To others, it is simply a Halloween decoration. The Feerick, Nugent, MacCartney Law Offices found out the hard way that the simple act of decorating the front porch of  
Once you've established that it's not, take your awesome (not racist!) costume and eat candy, in the true Halloween spirit. This article was originally published on Oct. 14, 2017 Get Even More  
There are references to the carving of turnips, beets and potatoes at Halloween in Ireland in the 19th century, but the conflation of the Jack-o'-lantern story with pumpkin-carving seems to have  
Halloween is time for traditions like pumpkin carving, trick-or-treating and, to hear some tell it, all-too-predictable displays of racism. The holiday has never been a poster child for political  
Jack O’Lantern appears as a term for a carved vegetable lantern from the early 19th century, and by 1866, there was a recorded link between the use of carved, hollowed-out pumpkins resembling faces and the season of Halloween. The origin of the name Jack O’Lantern draws from the folk tales of the wandering soul, but probably also draws from  
The Grand Pumpkin was a giant pumpkin which appears in all the pumpkin patches in the world on Halloween and brings candy to kids who truly believe in him. Bart claims to have made him up to mess with Milhouse, but his big childlike belief brought the Grand Pumpkin to life. When the Grand Pumpkin learned people cut pumpkins on Halloween to make funny faces, and make pumpkin bread out of them  
Are these black Halloween pumpkins RACIST? Someone in New York saw these black jack-o-laterns on the steps of a law firm and went to News 12 to investigate.  
In 2023, Americans spent an estimated $844 million on pumpkins specifically for Halloween — not quite the same chunk of change spent on candy, but still a solid slice of the overall $12.2  
That means that not only are there Halloween decorations everywhere, but everything has pumpkins in it, and social justice activists have to scream “that’s racist”. The social justice crybully crowd has been doing this for at least a decade. 
And so, as Halloween approaches, we have a new paper in the journal GeoHumanities called: “The perilous whiteness of pumpkins” (reference and free download below). And it’s not about pumpkins bred for a lack of coloration, either: it’s how this seasonal gourd bears a horrible burden of racism and oppression. 
Here are six things you may not know about them. 1. From Central America to Global Gardens. Pumpkins are a member of the gourd family, which includes cucumbers, honeydew melons, cantaloupe  
Bed, Bath and Beyond were forced to pull black pumpkins from their shelves because apparently a black pumpkin is a form of "black face", and therefore is racist and offensive. I'm bewildered here. It seems that the color black is somehow offensive. Thankfully, many private pumpkin farmers have taken it upon themselves to sell painted black  
Halloween has been my favorite holiday since I was as little as I can remember. I love everything about this Holiday and all the tradition that comes with it. Seattle should be glad I’m not living there because step 1 would be send my kid to school dressed in a pumpkin Halloween costume on Halloween. Then step 2. 
This carved pumpkin doubles as both Halloween decor and a candy dish. Simply carve out two holes for eyes and a wide smile for a mouth. Craft eyes out of paper and fill the pumpkin's mouth with your favorite candy. Set outside for trick-or-treaters to enjoy, or keep the candy stash inside for yourself! 
I'm Pamela Pumpkin and you're about to do Pamela Pumpkins Halloween workout. Alright, come on. Shake off the Skittles, shake off the racist, shake off those candy corns. Now, ride the witches broom. Ride the witches broom. Ride the witches broom. Ride the witches broom. </p>

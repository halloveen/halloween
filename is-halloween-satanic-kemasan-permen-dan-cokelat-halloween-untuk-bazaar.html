        <p>LaVey stipulated three holidays for his version of Satanism. The first and most important date is each Satanist's own birthday. It is, after all, a religion centered on the self, so it is understandable that this is the most significant day to a Satanist. The other two holidays are Walpurgisnacht (April 30) and Halloween (October 31). 
It has less to do with anything satanic and more to do with superstition and our relationship with death. For approximately the past 1,200 years, Halloween has been defined, in part, by the  
Halloween: All in a Name. The name “Halloween” traces back to Catholicism. Halloween comes from the two words of “Hallow,” which means holy person and “een,” which is supposed to mean “eve.”. Hallow refers to the “holy people” or the saints celebrated within the Catholic Church on All Saints’ Day, which occurs on November 1. 
One night, a conniving local drunkard named Jack trapped the Prince of Darkness in a tree by hacking a sign of the cross into the bark. In exchange for letting Satan climb down, Jack had him vow  
Televangelist Pat Robertson still warns that Halloween is a day when millions of children “celebrate Satan.”. “There’s a longstanding discourse in America about ‘innocents at risk  
They also buy into this story about so and so. They think it’s satanic and idolatrous and dishonoring to God. So here’s a kind of classic example from the Christian perspective. CLIP: So Halloween was a celebration to honor or remember the dead. 
I believe Halloween is a fun and happy holiday, not something that is evil or bad. The day was originally created as a Pagan holiday to worship those who have passed on. Paganism is the worship of nature and Earth, but unfortunately, it has been often associated with satanism. This is far from the truth as these are two entirely different things. 
By Nathaniel Parry. With roots in Europe’s Christianization, Halloween is something of a hybrid holiday strongly influenced by ancient pagan beliefs, and for this reason, its celebration has long been somewhat controversial within the Christian faith. The Puritans of early New England despised the holiday, with Reverend Increase Mather  
Halloween season is upon us, and the familiarity of the holiday is intoxicating. Often thought of as dark, spooky and even satanic, Halloween actually stems from a much more thoughtful celebration  
Ironically, though many modern Christians have denounced Halloween as satanic, its very name is derived from a Catholic holiday.. On May 13 of 609 C.E., Pope Boniface IV began an anniversary that would come to be known as All Saints’ Day — a time to honor saints and martyrs — when he dedicated the Pantheon in Rome as a church. 
For Christians, Halloween brings a wide variety of responses. Some see no problem with the holiday and celebrate with the normal traditions. Other believers see a huge problem with the association Halloween has with death, darkness, and evil. 
Samhain is a pagan religious festival originating from an ancient Celtic spiritual tradition. In modern times, Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced “sow‑win”) is usually celebrated from October  
The infamous founder of the Satanic Church, Anton LaVey, in setting up his novel religion chose Halloween not because the holiday had anything whatsoever to do with satanism, but because it marked the end of autumn, and also provided his church with the spooky backdrop he liked to invoke in order to gain attention. 
Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain and is now a worldwide event. Learn more about Halloween's origins, traditions, interesting facts, scary movies and more. 
Consider one of the earliest accounts of the saints: the names of the “martyrs and victors” listed at the back of the oldest dated book in the world. Written in November of 411, in the Christian Aramaic dialect of Syriac, the saints’ names are organized according to the calendar, listing the month and date on which each saint was killed—or, as the scribe puts it, when each “received  
So perhaps it’s no surprise that at Halloween “the dead” (who used to be the focus of the festival) are joined by other, more obviously sinister beings. Or so we’re told. What’s that about? Halloween traditions are not all about honouring the saints and other departed souls. They also include “trick or treat”. 
Carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and wearing scary costumes are some of the time-honored traditions of Halloween. Yet, the Halloween holiday has its roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced "SAH-win"), a pagan religious celebration to welcome the harvest at the end of summer, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. 
Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31, the evening before All Saints’ Day. The celebration marks the day before the Western Christian feast of All Saints and initiates the season of Allhallowtide. In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious. 
According to historian Nicholas Rogers, author of Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, Samhain was a “time of stock-taking and perhaps sacrifice” — including probably animal  
Halloween can be a strange holiday because it seems both supernatural (all the references to gravestones and ghosts) and secular (candy and wild parties). Some Christians wonder if it has a dark supernatural origin, whether it represents Satan’s birthday. The idea may sound scary, but it raises  </p>

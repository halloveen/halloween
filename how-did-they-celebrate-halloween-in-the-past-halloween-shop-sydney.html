        <p>Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and  
Halloween's origins can be traced to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Over the centuries, Halloween evolved, taking on Christian influences, European myth and American consumerism. 
A child would be more likely to mention a talking skeleton than a sacred bonfire when discussing the origin of Halloween. Stacker compiled a list of ways that Halloween has changed over the last 100 years, from how we celebrate it on the day to the costumes we wear trick-or-treating. We've included events, inventions, and trends that changed  
Halloween traditions in the West date back thousands of years to the festival of Samhain (pronounced 'Soo-when', 'So-ween' or 'Saw-wen'), the Celtic New Year's festival. The name means "summer's end", and the festival marked the close of the harvest season and the coming of winter. 
Halloween had its origins in the festival of Samhain among the Celts of ancient Britain and Ireland. On the day corresponding to November 1 on contemporary calendars, the new year was believed to begin. That date was considered the beginning of the winter period, the date on which the herds were returned from pasture and land tenures were renewed. 
Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain and is now a worldwide event. Learn about the jack‑o‑lantern, trick‑or‑treating, Halloween costumes and more. 
Enchanting Etymology. Before jumping into the ancient holiday's history, it's helpful to start with the basics and learn the origins of its name. The word Halloween has evolved from Hallowe'en. In turn, this whimsical word is shorthand for “hallowed evening,” and refers specifically to All Hallows' Eve. All Hallows' Eve is a celebration  
According to Kelly, Halloween took root in the U.S. sometime around the 19th century, when the Irish immigrated to America, bringing their traditions and celebrations, including All Saints’ Day  
All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween as it is commonly referred, is a global celebration on October 31. It developed from the ancient Celtic ritual of Samhain, which was, in the simplest terms, a festival celebrating the changing of the seasons from light to dark (summer to winter). This would usually take place around November 1. 
Play parties were not a direct descendant of Halloween; they did not occur on any particular night, had no religious affiliation, and were more concerned with producing future generations than with honoring or placating past ones. But they did keep alive certain Halloween traditions, such as telling ghost tales and divining future romance with  
If it weren’t for the tricks of the past, there’d be no treats today. Halloween was born nearly 2,000 years ago in the Celtic countries of northwestern Europe.  They begged for money or  
Lotte World’s Halloween Horror Festival. Go enjoy a day at this popular amusement park while marveling at the awesome Halloween-themed places they have managed to set up. They also host a Halloween-themed parade, during which candies will be given away to children. Many of the attractions will get a Halloween do-over. 
All Hallows’ Day is also referred to as All Saints’ Day, a day (November 1st) to celebrate the saints with a feast. As Aelfric of Eynsham states around the year 1000: “se monað ongynð on ealra halgena mæssedæg,” or “the month begins on the day of the mass for All Saints.” 
It is believed that Samhain and the Christian Saints holidays influenced each other and the modern Halloween. How did Halloween develop in the U.S.? In colonial America, Halloween as we know it was not celebrated. The Puritans of New England strongly opposed the holiday and rejected many other holidays. 
The Romans conquered much of the Celtic tribal lands when they invaded from mainland Europe in AD 43, and over the next four hundred years of occupation and rule, they appear to have assimilated many of their own celebrations into the existing Celtic festivals. One such example may help to explain the current Halloween tradition of ‘bobbing  
The history of trick-or-treating, and how it became a Halloween tradition. Children dressing in costumes and going door-to-door for treats is a relatively modern tradition—but its origins can be  
Samhain is a pagan religious festival originating from an ancient Celtic spiritual tradition. In modern times, Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced “sow‑win”) is usually celebrated from October  
The UK has seen something of a “Halloween surge” in recent years, and much of that has been driven by businesses keen to cash in. A 2015 article in The Guardian quoted Tesco's Halloween buyer, Bryony Watson, saying, “Halloween has doubled in size over the past 10 years.” 
Halloween is largely celebrated as a secular holiday in the United States, but it is properly the eve or vigil of All Saints Day, one of the most important Catholic feasts of the liturgical year and a Holy Day of Obligation. 
But taking a look at the past, we find the first examples of “Halloween” -similar celebrations already at the time of the ancient Romans, which due to cultural exchanges with the Celtic people used to celebrate the dead between October and November, although their celebrations were considered pagan and therefore were not supported by a  </p>

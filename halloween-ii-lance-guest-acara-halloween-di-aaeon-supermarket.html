        <p>The Last Starfighter director Nick Castle stated in an interview, "When I was assigned to the film, Lance Guest was the first name I wrote down on my list for Alex after seeing him in Halloween II."

The original “Halloween” (review here) is so good that “Halloween II” holds up to repeated viewings in spite of its shortfalls by simple virtue of being “more of the night he came home.” As its own movie, “Halloween II” is not so good. As a fan service follow-up, the film has a few things in its favor. 
Rick Rosenthal's original ending for Halloween II featured Jimmy as a survivor. The character played by Lance guest shared with Laurie Strode the final scene of the film.

Halloween is a horror movie; Halloween II, in contrast, is a slasher movie. Now, I want to be quite clear about something: when I use expressions like “horror movie” and “slasher movie”, I am doing so not as a form of judgement, but merely as a form of classification.

In addition to reviewing the first (original) Halloween movie I thought I’d travel on over here and grant another 5 stars to this Blu-ray. I watched Halloween 1&amp;2 profusely as a child when my Mom was an avid VCR recorder and now, seeing it in such superb quality is wonderful and a great bringer of nostalgic feelings.The price is cheap for such good quality. </p>

        <h2><strong>all saints day and halloween krul tepes girls white halloween</strong></h2>
        <p>To hallow is "to make holy or sacred, to sanctify or consecrate, to venerate." The adjective hallowed, as used in The Lord's Prayer, means holy, consecrated, sacred, or revered. The noun hallow, as used in Hallowtide, is a synonym of the word saint. So, there are some differences between Halloween, All Saints Day and All Souls Day, however they  
"Halloween" has also been translated to "Eve of All Hallows," which was a holy day celebrating the day before All Saints Day, that Reverend Richard Donohoe, the vicar of Catholic Charities for the Diocese of Birmingham, described as "a celebration of the communion of saints, those people we believe are in heaven, through good works and God's  
The word “Halloween”—or “Hallowe’en”—comes from All Hallow’s Eve. All Hallows Eve is the vigil celebration of All Saints Day —also known as All Hallows Day. The word “hallow” means “holy.” (In the Our Father we pray, “Hallowed be thy name.”) All Saints Day is a Holy Day of Obligation, and a major feast on the  
All Saints' Day On May 13, A.D. 609, Pope Boniface IV dedicated the Pantheon in Rome in honor of all Christian martyrs, and the Catholic feast of All Martyrs Day was established in the Western church. 
But Halloween also finds a long heritage in the Christian observance of All Saints Day. While the feast day was originally held in March, Pope Gregory III transferred its observance to Nov. 1 in 844. 
Pope Gregory III (731-741) dedicated an oratory in the original St. Peter’s Basilica in honor of all the saints on November 1 (at least according to some accounts), and this date then became the official date for the celebration of the feast of All Saints in Rome. St. Bede (d. 735) recorded the celebration of All Saints Day on November 1 in  
In the 7th century, the Catholic Church established November 1 as All Saints' Day, a day commemorating all the saints of the church.  began to be called All-Hallows Eve and, eventually  
Tags. The triduum of Halloween, All Saints, and All Souls is a significant three-day period in the Catholic Church, providing a time for reflection, remembrance, and spiritual contemplation. This unique celebration, which takes place from October 31 to November 2, holds great importance for Catholics around the world. 
The celebration of All Saints’ Day is one of the ways Catholics live out this profession. All Saints’ Day came to be a very important liturgical day, and today it is a holy day of obligation, meaning that Catholics must observe it by going to Mass, as they do on Sundays. This makes All Saints different from the commemorations of individual  
Halloween may be a secular affair today, dominated by candy, costumes and trick-or-treating,  In the 800s, the Church designated November 1 as All Saints’ Day. 
"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus." (Revelation 14:12)Origin of All Saints Day. The origin of All Saints' Day can be traced back to the early Christian Church when it was established as a day to remember and celebrate the martyrs and other saints who had died for their faith. 
All Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows' Day, [3] the Feast of All Saints, [4] [5] the Feast of All Hallows, [6] the Solemnity of All Saints, [6] and Hallowmas, [6] [7] is a Christian solemnity celebrated in honour of all the saints of the Church, whether they are known or unknown. 
Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31, the evening before All Saints’ Day. The celebration marks the day before the Western Christian feast of All Saints and initiates the season of Allhallowtide. In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious. 
Halloween or Hallowe'en [7] [8] (less commonly known as Allhalloween, [9] All Hallows' Eve, [10] or All Saints' Eve) [11] is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. 
The origin of All Saints’ Day cannot be traced with certainty, and it has been observed on various days in different places. A feast of all martyrs was kept on May 13 in the Eastern church according to Ephraem Syrus (died c. 373), which may have determined the choice of May 13 by Pope Boniface IV when he dedicated the Pantheon in Rome as a church in honour of the Blessed Virgin and all  
The name itself comes from All Hallow’s Eve – that is, the Vigil of All Saints’ Day, when Catholics remember those who have gone before us to enter our heavenly home. Immediately afterwards, on November 2, the Church commemorates all the faithful departed still detained in Purgatory, and prays in suffrage for them. 
In the 9th century, Pope Gregory moved the celebration back to the time of the fire festivals, but declared it All Saints’ Day, on November 1. All Souls’ Day would follow on November 2  
From this, Nov. 2 became a day more focused on all the dead, hence called All Souls Day. All over Europe and in South America these two days are celebrated with visits to the cemeteries and by special commemorations in church to remember the dead. All Saints Day is marked by the Catholic Church as a special feast day. 
What Day Is All Saints' Day 2024? All Saints' Day is on Friday, Nov. 1, 2024.It’s preceded by All Hallows' Eve on Thursday, Oct. 31, and followed by All Souls' Day on Saturday, Nov. 2. 
In fact, Morton says that the Halloween we celebrate today is likely a mix of both Samhain and All Saints' Day. And while Halloween has been celebrated in the U.S. since at least the late 1800s  </p>

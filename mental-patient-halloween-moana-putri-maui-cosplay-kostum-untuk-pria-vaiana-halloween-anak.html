        <p>For all the fun that can be had carving pumpkins, eating candy and dressing in costumes, unfortunately October is also a month with Halloween stigma. Typically, horrors involve “haunted asylum” attractions with depictions of residents as violent monsters. In other cases, some stores sell “mental patient” costumes with straitjackets. 
1. Ghost (Boo!) Classic! Not only is a ghost a cost-effective way to make your own costume, it also doesn’t make an entire group of people who are actually more likely to be victims of violence than violent themselves seem “scary.”. Cut out those eye holes and embrace your scary without isolating an innocent passerby who’s been  
Halloween is a time for thrills, chills and spooky fun—but for some, the holiday can stir up feelings of anxiety or fear. “Fear is a natural response, but context is key,” says Dr. Laura Eddy, therapist at Modern Minds. “Choosing to experience a scare can be fun, but ongoing fear or anxiety that feels uncontrollable can impact mental  
4. People with mental illness are not actually scary. Halloween-shop mental patient costumes, with their straitjackets and gore, reinforce the same false message the media portrays to us by talking about mental illness only within the context of events like mass shootings. 
4. Bojack from “Bojack Horseman”. “Bojack Horseman” fans celebratee when it was brought back for a fifth season. If you want to dress up as Bojack, check out Carbon Costume’s guide for making the costume yourself. via Carbon Costume website. 
Straight Jackets. For around $20 you can have your very own straight jacket this Halloween and dress as a “mental patient”. This decade-old connection with mental illness and straight jackets really needs to fizzle out. In fact, people with high functioning mental illnesses are able to thrive in life personally and professionally. 
Halloween decor indoor or outdoor should reflect appropriate harvest or scary themes. Ghosts, witches, goblins, zombies, and the like are all stigma-free—as are pumpkins, cornstalks, and spiderwebs. 4. Decide if the time is right to fight the fight. Halloween is a season of fun for children of all ages. 
Learn how Halloween and mental health depictions perpetuate the stigma of mental illness, and what you can do to promote inclusivity this Halloween.Photo by David Menidrey on UnsplashIt’s no secret that mental illness is stigmatized in our society, and is amplified during Halloween with frightening images of abandoned insane asylums, escaped psychopaths, and deranged killer clowns. 
In the spirit of Halloween, this blog seeks to unravel the layers of psychological masks we wear and the profound impact they have on our mental well-being. By understanding the symbolism of masks, the psychological consequences of concealing emotions, and the importance of authenticity, we can embark on a journey toward better mental health. 
When I think of "mental patient" I think of the horrible, old fashioned asylum type stuff. Like the stuff Nellie Bly exposed. The straight jacket, the drooling, the crazed eyes &amp; hair, overdone to a point that you KNOW this isn't just someone who's on Lexapro &amp; living a "normal" life. To me there's a big difference between the 2. 
Lance Tivoli (died October 31/November 1, 2018) was an inmate of Smith's Grove Sanitarium.

Set mostly in the fictional Illinois town of Haddonfield, the film follows mental patient Michael Myers, who was committed to a sanitarium for murdering his teenage sister one Halloween night during his childhood; he escapes 15 years later and returns to Haddonfield, where he stalks teenage babysitter Laurie Strode and her friends while his  
Karen Mercy is a minor character that appears as an institutionalized mental patient in the Unrated Cut of the 2007 Halloween remake film. Fifteen years after Michael Myers was locked up at Smith's Grove Sanitarium, Karen arrived there for unknown medical conditions or mental disorders, but eventually, on October 30, 2007, she would be sexually assaulted by two of the sanitarium's employees  
Sometimes the patients are actually in charge of the mental hospital, which can be quiet unnerving. For an unhinged psych patient, you'll ideally wear some white pants and a strait jacket, which can be purchased online at a low price. This sends the idea that you need to be kept away from people at all costs.

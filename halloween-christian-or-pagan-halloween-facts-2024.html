        <h2><strong>halloween christian or pagan aqw halloween armor</strong></h2>
        <p>Origin of Halloween. Halloween is a commingled word formed from both “All Hallows” and “Even,” or “E’en,” the Scottish word for evening. Hallow means “to make holy.”. Halloween is meant to refer to the evening before All Holies Day, also known as All Saints Day, a religious holiday in the Roman Catholic and many Protestant  
Halloween’s roots in paganism may raise concerns, but it is the intent of the heart that matters most. As Christians, we must be vigilant not to allow the holiday to glorify or trivialize evil, but rather to celebrate in ways that align with our faith. At the heart of Halloween’s history are themes of death, fear, and the supernatural. 
By Nathaniel Parry. With roots in Europe’s Christianization, Halloween is something of a hybrid holiday strongly influenced by ancient pagan beliefs, and for this reason, its celebration has long been somewhat controversial within the Christian faith. The Puritans of early New England despised the holiday, with Reverend Increase Mather  
As the population began to convert to Christianity the holiday began to lose its popularity. However, instead of eradicating pagan practices such as “Halloween” or Samhain, the church used these holidays with a Christian twist to bring paganism and Christianity together, making it easier for local populations to convert to the state religion. 
The brief account seeks to vindicate Halloween from its “Satanic” and barbaric origins. While the dark side of Halloween may have been overemphasized, Christians must still acknowledge that the holiday originated (at least) in pagan and mythical practices. The extent to which such practices can be categories as “Satanic” is a debate of  
The most straightforward answer is that Halloween is "secular." People who celebrate this day in a religious context generally do not call it Halloween. Also, the common practices associated with Halloween such as costuming and giving of treats are secular celebrations. Jack-o-lanterns themselves came to us through folklore. 
From a Christian perspective, we can say that this is our rendition of how the “trick or treat” tradition began without its pagan origins. Halloween Background: The Christian Impact. Truly, the long and rich history of how Christians paved their way towards Halloween is impressive. They had many challenges from pagan aficionados to royal  
Historical Background . A few of today's popular celebrations associated with Halloween have pagan roots stemming from the ancient Celtic festival, Samhain.This harvest festival of the Druids ushered in the New Year, beginning on the evening of October 31 with the lighting of bonfires and offering of sacrifices. 
Halloween is a controversial holiday for Christians, with differing opinions on whether or not it is appropriate to celebrate. Some Christians argue that Halloween is rooted in pagan practices and promotes darkness and evil, making it incompatible with their faith. 
So atheist activists, neo-pagans and evangelical Christians are all, oddly, in complete agreement: Halloween is pagan in origin and both the date and the traditions around it derive from a druidic, Celtic festival. This strange consensus is made even more ironic by the fact that these ideas are almost entirely wrong. 
It's a good bet retailers won't entertain high expectations of getting $79.82 per household from the Christian market. Many Christians refuse to participate in Halloween. Some are wary of its pagan origins; others of its dark, ghoulish imagery; still others are concerned for the safety of their children. 
Traditionally, October 31, which is named Halloween or All Hallows’ Eve, has been considered a pagan holiday. On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a religious feast day  
I believe that Christians can still use what the world seeks to corrupt for holy purposes. Christians didn't build on pagan foundations. They excavated pagan traditions, dug out all rot, and then built beautiful new traditions on top of the evil that was once there. All Saints Day, where the origins of Halloween are rooted, is a beautiful holiday. 
Halloween, or the ancient Samhain, is considered the time of year when the veil between our world and the spirit world is at its thinnest. As darkness falls and families light their pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, they are, perhaps unknowingly, repeating the ancient traditions of honoring the dead and marking the beginning of the ‘dark half’ of the year. 
The celebration of Halloween, a festival rooted in ancient pagan customs, remains a point of contention among many Christians today. The potential spiritual implications embedded in the festival’s origins often create a struggle for Christians who may wish to participate in this widely celebrated holiday. 
Halloween is a Christian festival because in there he points out that it’s actually kind of controversial to say what should be really straightforward, namely that Halloween is a Christian feast. It is the eve of all holies or all hallowed. So all saints, the word for saint is the word for holy is hallowed. 
Samhain is a pagan religious festival originating from an ancient Celtic spiritual tradition. In modern times, Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced “sow‑win”) is usually celebrated from October  
Samhain’s sacrifices morphed into Halloween’s handing out a different kind of offering: candy. Nevertheless, Halloween contains roots in a pagan celebration of death and rebirth. So, should Christians really celebrate Halloween? Christians and Halloween. For many Christian communities, there are three main responses to Halloween. 
According to historian Nicholas Rogers, author of Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, Samhain was a “time of stock-taking and perhaps sacrifice” — including probably animal  
Due to its decidedly pagan origins, the answer to the question as to whether Christians should celebrate Halloween is a resounding no. The answer to the question as to whether can Christians participate in Halloween activities without compromising their faith is more difficult. </p>

        <h2><strong>say no to halloween lagu poli halloween</strong></h2>
        <p>This web page argues that Halloween is wrong and evil, and exposes children to fear and the enemy. It provides biblical reasons, videos, and a prayer to resist and overcome Halloween. 
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
Here are a few simple ideas you can customize or build from: “Our family doesn’t like what Halloween stands for so we don’t participate.”. “My family celebrates the fall season a  
The word Halloween literally means the evening before All Hallows Day (or All Saint’s Day) celebrated on November 1. Halloween is also the shortened name of Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Evening and All Saint’s Eve which is celebrated on October 31. The origin and meaning of Halloween are derived from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, but  
Halloween is a day when people glorify Satan without their knowledge. It represents darkness, and we represent light. We have no deal with the useless deeds of the kingdom of evil. We should condemn even the slightest hint of evil. Say “No” to Halloween. Share these three truths about Halloween with your children when you go home today. 
While there is no Biblical response to Halloween specifically, the Bible does have a lot to say about death, darkness, and evil. And for some, Halloween is a season to reckon with these themes. Below, we have gathered 13 Bible verses to read and maybe to share too leading up to Halloween. Terri Robertson is the Senior Editor, Digital, at  
Last week, the CDC released guidelines for celebrating Halloween in a time of COVID-19. Assorted activities were rank from lower to higher risk and, much to the chagrin of many a child and parent  
Answer. Due to its decidedly pagan origins, the answer to the question as to whether Christians should celebrate Halloween is a resounding no. The answer to the question as to whether can Christians participate in Halloween activities without compromising their faith is more difficult. Some Christians participate in Halloween simply by dressing  
The answer is complex. As you and your family prepare for Halloween, continue to study, pray, and seek God’s wisdom. Estimated reading time: 11 minutes. Across the world, the month of October ushers in a new season of weather, pumpkin themed foods, and fall celebrations. Also, October means the arrival of an often-celebrated day: Halloween. 
Three reasons not to celebrate Halloween. With the origins and the practices of Halloween in mind, here are three reasons why we believe you should consider ditching Halloween from your (and your children’s) lives: 1. God forbids the merging of pagan customs into our lives. “You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way; for every  
👻🎃 Halloween’s clock is ticking! 🎃👻. With just a few sunsets away from the haunting hour, you might find yourself scrambling to craft the perfect spooky aura. Let’s face it: No DIY haunted house or electric Halloween party is complete without a concoction of creepy sayings that can make bones shive 
Personally, I love Halloween and look forward to the knocks on the door on Halloween night from the little ones all dressed up in their Halloween costumes and these days, Master Frugal (who tells me he is way too old to go trick or treating) likes to get dressed up and be our designated door answerer. 
Evil spirits are no more active and sinister on Halloween than they are on any other day of the year; in fact, any day is a good day for Satan to prowl about seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8). But "greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). 
Halloween as we know it today has zero connection to any religion, it's a purely secular event and an excuse for kids to dress up and get free candy. If God has convicted you to personally avoid Halloween because it affects the relationship between you and God, then by all means refrain from participating. 
Spritual warfare is real and I'm not a fanatic or zealot- my demeanor is very laid back and down to earth. Though I made the decision then, time passes and I'm just starting to share my decision with friends and family now, because Halloween is approaching, who all say that Halloween is harmless. It's been tough. 
Don’t decorate your house with Halloween decorations. If you don’t want anything to do with Halloween, don’t decorate your house with anything that screams you celebrate it. Don’t put out pumpkins, fake cobwebs, or any other Halloween décor. Instead, leave your house plain so trick-or-treaters will know you aren't celebrating Halloween. 
The second Anti-Halloween animation this year! Yay! :)Music is Powerful by RoyatlyFreeMusic.com.God bless you all!P.S. At least his animation feels more righ 
This pastor does not celebrate Halloween and neither does her church. Many Christians celebrate Halloween Some churches and pastors even do I recently saw a church advertising they were having a Zombie Run Seriously God s House This pastor does not celebrate Halloween 
12. Have a spookily good Halloween! 13. Halloween is a real treat. 14. It’s the most frightful time of the year! 15. Have a fang-tastic night. (This is a great one to use if you are in a vampire costume!) 16. Happy Haunting! 17. Have a bootiful Halloween (Perfect way to answer the door in a ghost costume!) 18. I witch you a Happy Halloween 
“Do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you” (vv. 19b-20). “So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. </p>

Findings suggest that the Halloween effect can still be observed in 34 out of the 35 countries. A more aggressive trading strategy of shorting the market during summer and taking a long position in winter yields 4.77% more than the buy-and-hold strategy. A new explanation is offered for the persistence of the Halloween effect. 
Bouman and Jacobsen (2002) develop a simple trading strategy based on the Halloween indicator and the Sell-in-May effect, which invests in a market portfolio at the end of October for six months and sells the portfolio at the beginning of May, using the proceeds to purchase risk free short term Treasury bills and hold these from the beginning

Our simple new test for the Sell in May effect shows it not only defies stock market efficiency but also challenges the existence of a positive risk return trade off. When we examine the effect using all historical data for all stock market indices worldwide, we only find evidence of a significant positive ‘risk return’-trade-off during summer (May-October) in Mauritius. Pooling all  
We document the existence of a strong seasonal effect in stock returns based on the popular market saying Sell in May and go away, also known as the Halloween indicator. According to these words of market wisdom, stock market returns should be higher in the November-April period than those in the May-October period.

This paper investigates the existence of a calendar anomaly in stock market returns, namely the Halloween Effect, corroborated by Bouman &amp; Jacobsen (2002).

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Halloween effect evolution in the US stock market over its entire history. We employ various statistical techniques (average analysis, Student’s t-test, ANOVA, and the Mann-Whitney test) and the trading simulation approach to analyse the evolution of the Halloween effect. The results suggest that in the US stock market the  
U.S. stock market sectors and industries perform better during winter than summer from 1926 to 2006. In more than two-thirds of sectors and industries, the difference in summer and winter returns, known as the Halloween effect, is statistically significant. There are, however, large differences across sectors and industries. The effect is almost absent in sectors related to consumer

This paper uses stock market returns (2007-2015) and confirms the existence of Halloween effect anomaly after the 2008 financial crisis. Findings suggest that the Halloween effect can still be observed in 34 out of the 35 countries. A more aggressive trading strategy of shorting the market during summer and taking a long position in winter yields 4.77% more than the buy-and-hold strategy. A  
In what is considered to be a seminal piece of research on the subject, “The Halloween Indicator, ‘Sell in May and Go Away’: Another Puzzle,” authors Sven Bouman and Ben Jacobsen were among the first to document a strong seasonal effect in global stock markets.

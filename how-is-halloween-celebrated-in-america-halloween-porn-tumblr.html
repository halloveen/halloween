        <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2024 will occur on Thursday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people  
Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31 and noted for its pagan and religious roots and secular traditions. In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious, celebrated with parties, spooky costumes, jack-o’-lanterns, pumpkin carvings, and the giving of candy. 
Today, Halloween is celebrated with trick-or-treating, costumes, jack-o-lanterns and scary movies—all things which would likely be unrecognizable to those who took part in the holiday’s  
Then, in 1950, a group of students from a Philadelphia-area Sunday school sent the $17 they had collected trick-or-treating to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and another holiday tradition was born. A newly rich and powerful America celebrated Halloween by lending a helping hand to less fortunate peoples around the world. 
It is believed that today’s Halloween traditions were also influenced by folk customs and beliefs from the Celtic-speaking countries, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which is still celebrated in some places and has pagan origins.

The name "Halloween," of course, is a contraction of "All Hallow's Eve." That's the eve of All Saints Day, or All Hallows Day, as it was popularly known in Britain. As with Christmas Eve and the Easter vigil, the celebration of All Saints Day began with a service the night before, on All Hallow's Eve. 
It was believed that on that day, the souls of the dead returned to their homes, so people dressed in costumes and lit bonfires to ward off spirits. In this way, popular Halloween tropes such as witches, ghosts, and goblins became associated with the holiday. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. In the 7th century CE, Pope Boniface IV created All  
Halloween is celebrated each year on October 31. Halloween 2024 will take place on Thursday, October 31.  Latin America and Spain, All Souls’ Day, which takes place on November 2, is  
Places like Anoka in Minnesota, the self-proclaimed "Halloween capital of the world," paved the way for this. In Anoka, the first official Halloween celebrations of the USA took place in 1920. Scary costumes became more and more popular in America from the 1930s on, and a huge market was built around Halloween products. 
This tradition was a few centuries old by the time she put on her first event. Mrs. Krebs' original vision definitely did impact how people in America celebrate Halloween, however, and the Halloween Frolic of Hiawatha, Kansas, continues to be observed annually along with the many similar festivals it inspired. 
While Halloween conjures images of candy and costumes around the U.S., the holiday looks different across the globe. Here's a breakdown into how the holiday is celebrated in seven other countries.

In America, Halloween is always celebrated on Oct. 31. Countries that celebrate Halloween as we do, like Canada, share the same day. However, not everyone is as Halloween obsessed as Americans. 
Halloween in early 19th-century America was a night for pranks, tricks, illusions, and anarchy. Jack-o’-lanterns dangled from the ends of sticks, and teens jumped out from behind walls to  
Every year, cities and towns all over the world celebrate with festivals, parades, and theme park events.

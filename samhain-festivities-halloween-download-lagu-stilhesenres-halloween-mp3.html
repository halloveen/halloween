        <p>Wicca celebration of Samhain takes on many forms, from the traditional fire ceremonies to celebrations that embrace many aspects of modern Halloween, as well as activities related to honoring  
It was May 13 in the year 609 that Pope Boniface IV declared a celebration called All Saints’ Day, also called All-hallows or All-hallowmas in Middle English; the day before it was thus known as  
Samhain – Explore more about Samhain. On or around the 31st October in the northern hemisphere, 1st May in the southern, Samhain (Samhuinn) is the festival of the dead, a festival of remembrance and honouring of our dear departed friends and relations. Discover more about Samhain rituals here. 
While Samhain is still celebrated among pagans in jubilant social gatherings across the globe, the holiday also directly inspired many of the Halloween traditions in practice today, including trick-or-treating and carving Jack-o-Lanterns. Explore the vibrant rituals of this ancient Halloween predecessor in the gallery below. 
Samhain: 4th Fire Festival of the Celtic Year. Samhain ( pronounced /sow-ween/ in Irish) is the final fire festival of the Celtic year. Between October 31st and November 1st, the harvest season comes to a close and winter is ushered in. The traditions that we use to celebrate Halloween today began thousands of years ago with this ancient Irish  
Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and  
One of the main events of Halloween is trick or treating, where on the evening of 31 October, children dress up in their costumes and knock on neighbours doors to get some sweets and treats. Similarly at Samhain people would have dressed up in their masks to imitate the ghosts of people passed into the other world, and received offerings on  
In the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages, Samhain is known as the "calends of winter". The Brittonic lands of Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany held festivals on 31 October similar to the Gaelic one. In Wales it is Calan Gaeaf, in Cornwall it is Allantide or Kalan Gwav, and in Brittany it is Kalan Goañv. 
19/10/2017. Samhain is a Gaelic festival, which marks the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the “darker half” of the year. This Celtic tradition is still observed by some minorities today. Halloween has its roots in Samhain, but they are not the same thing. Halloween has become a children’s favourite because of the  
Across the globe, Samhain is now celebrated alongside many different festivals. In Latin America similar festivals such as Dia de los Muertos and La Calabiuza [Day of the Dead], and Dia da Bruxas [Witch’s Day] are celebrated in conjunction with the modern Halloween festivals, many sharing the Celts’ original beliefs around spirits and Samhain. 
But in earlier times it referred to one of the four great festivals of the traditional Gaelic year, celebrated on 1 November (though festivities spanned a few days either side) and so corresponding closely in date to our Halloween. 
From Samhain to Halloween. When Christianity reached Ireland in the 5th century CE, the Catholic Church found it easier to convert the Celts by incorporating certain pagan celebrations into the Catholic calendar. Attempting to subsume Samhain under a contextually similar Christian holiday, All Saints Day was created and initially assigned to 13  
Here are more than 50 Samhain recipes you could try. Some traditional Samhain foods include apples, hazelnuts, and barmbrack (a type of bread with charms). Modern celebrations also include pumpkins. Some people like to bake Soul Cakes, however, I cannot find reputable historical evidence that links Soul Cakes to Samhain or paganism. It appears  
Samhain, in ancient Celtic religion, one of the most important and sinister calendar festivals of the year. At Samhain, held on November 1, the world of the gods was believed to be made visible to humankind, and the gods played many tricks on their mortal worshippers; it was a time fraught with 
There remains little doubt that Samhain held a central place in the imagination of the Celts, where the festivities associated with several local gods became entangled, over the course of perhaps a thousand years, with the feast of the god of the dead. Remnants of these celebrations have come down to us in our own celebrations of Halloween. 
Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31, the evening before All Saints’ Day. The celebration marks the day before the Western Christian feast of All Saints and initiates the season of Allhallowtide. In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious. 
Halloween, or the ancient Samhain, is considered the time of year when the veil between our world and the spirit world is at its thinnest. As darkness falls and families light their pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, they are, perhaps unknowingly, repeating the ancient traditions of honoring the dead and marking the beginning of the ‘dark half’ of the year. 
Samhain was a significant festival that the ancient Celts once celebrated. It has evolved into the Halloween festivities that are celebrated in many countries across the globe today. 
Another difference between Samhain and Halloween is that most Samhain rituals are held in private rather than in public. When to Start the Celebrations. If you want to start honoring this pagan tradition, you might wonder when to start. The timing of contemporary Samhain celebrations varies according to spiritual tradition and geography. 
The legacy of Samhain and its ancient Irish traditions linger on in modern-day Halloween. Whether it's the mystical origins of Samhain; bonfires, Jack-o’-Lanterns, old Irish recipes, trick or treating or other games, you’ll experience a flavour of old Celtic ways whether you celebrate at home or at its place of origin, in Ireland. </p>

The Halloween indicator is fascinating for the reason that it is an empirical anomaly as well as a mystery.  Sven Bouman and Ben Jacobsen published a paper in the American Economic Review that  
We document the existence of a strong seasonal effect in stock returns based on the popular market saying Sell in May and go away, also known as the Halloween indicator. According to these words of market wisdom, stock market returns should be higher in the November-April period than those in the May-October period. 
Bouman and Jacobsen (2002) develop a simple trading strategy based on the Halloween indicator and the Sell-in-May effect, which invests in a market portfolio at the end of October for six months and sells the portfolio at the beginning of May, using the proceeds to purchase risk free short term Treasury bills and hold these from the beginning  
In what is considered to be a seminal piece of research on the subject, “The Halloween Indicator, ‘Sell in May and Go Away’: Another Puzzle,” authors Sven Bouman and Ben Jacobsen were among the first to document a strong seasonal effect in global stock markets. In 36 of the 37 developed and emerging markets they studied between 1973 and

We provide the first empirical explanation for the existence of the Halloween effect, commonly known as "Sell in May and go away." This phenomenon suggests that stocks perform better between November and April than they do between May and October, and is observable in equity markets of 36 countries, from at least 1970 to present (Bouman and  
Our simple new test for the Sell in May effect shows it not only defies stock market efficiency but also challenges the existence of a positive risk return trade off. When we examine the effect using all historical data for all stock market indices worldwide, we only find evidence of a significant positive ‘risk return’-trade-off during summer (May-October) in Mauritius.

U.S. stock market sectors and industries perform better during winter than summer from 1926 to 2006. In more than two-thirds of sectors and industries, the difference in summer and winter returns, known as the Halloween effect, is statistically significant. There are, however, large differences across sectors and industries. </p>

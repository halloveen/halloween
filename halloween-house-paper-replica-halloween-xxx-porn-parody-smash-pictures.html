        <p>Step Six: Add Spooky Halloween House Final Elements. Time to add the final elements that make this house live up to the word "spooky." Take one end of the fence and add glue to the end tab. Glue this tab to the edge of the house. Next, add glue to the bottom tabs of the fence and glue to the platform. 
This is a 13-day Halloween challenge where I post a free house pattern each day for the next 13 days finishing on October 30th. The first paper house is the Halloween House No. 1 - a simple gable front house with a steep roof and a spooky coffin-shaped door. It's easy to construct with the pattern provided. 
It's fairly complicated to make, but looks great when finished. Get the PDF and SVG patterns for this house as the Faded Mansion in January 2019. The photo below shows the Faded Mansion decorated for Halloween. It's Design No. 42 in the Paper Glitter Glue Library. 
Layer your shingle strips one at a time, and cover the entire roof piece like so. 7. Now it’s time to put all the pieces together. Start by sliding the center section into place and gluing the tabs to the inside of the main house structure. Then, attach the roof fencing, and place the roof on top of the house. 
Step 6: Glue on the roof. Once the paper haunted house roof tabs are firmly glued down, glue on the roof. Apply a thick bead of glue along the edge of the roof. Center the roof over the house so that the overhang is about 1/4 inch on the front and back of the house. Use painter’s tape to hold the roof in place while the glue dries.

It’s time for autumn leaves, warm cider, and haunted houses! To celebrate the season, I’ve designed a set of paper haunted house lanterns that you can use 
The plaster house below has fine stone granules (kind of like large grains of sand) mixed with the paint. The Stone House with Three Gables was painted over texture paste. And as the final texture suggestion, you can use a stencil to mimic stone on your paper Halloween House. This is one of my favorite techniques. 
5. Glue Door &amp; Windows to House. Use liquid glue to glue the parchment paper door and windows to the inside of the haunted house, making sure to match each one to the right opening size (as indicated by the numbers on the template). 6. Assemble DIY Haunted House.

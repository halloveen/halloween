The Guardians of the Galaxy ride is described as a family ride. Guardians of the Galaxy Ride Intensity. As I mentioned, this is designed to be a family ride. 
When Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind opened at EPCOT on May 27th, it didn't have a standby line. If you're going to Disney World and you want to experience this attraction, you'll need either a Virtual Queue Boarding Group or a paid Individual Lightning Lane Reservation.

The ride seats 4 people per car, and each car spins to follow the action of the ride! Take a look at the ride vehicles!

Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind uses a virtual queue and also offers paid Lightning Lane Single Pass (LLSP) access, which costs $14 to $18 per ride (depending upon anticipated crowds). Cosmic Rewind often totally sells out in advance, with limited availability as many as 8 days in advance under the new pre-arrival ride reservation system. 
Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind is an enclosed roller coaster at Epcot at Walt Disney World, [4] [5] [6] manufactured by Dutch company Vekoma.

The Guardians of the Galaxy ride is definitely worth it as we detail in our Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! ride review. Due to its Marvel theming, dance-worthy soundtrack, and thrilling ride system, Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! is one of the most popular rides at Disneyland Park. 
Well, they’re worlds apart! While Webslingers is an interactive dark ride, Guardians is a bona fide thrill ride, offering a much more intense experience. Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout offers a more intense ride than Space Mountain, especially considering the height and the impulsivity of the drops. </p>

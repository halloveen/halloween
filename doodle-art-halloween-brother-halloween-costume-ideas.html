Try to make these lines more or less equidistant, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; you can eyeball it. Most important is to make sure your vertical and horizontal lines are slightly longer than your diagonal lines.

It seemed like a good opportunity for a cat hero, since the winner of last year‚Äôs Candy Cup Doodle was Yellow Witch and her black cat. The original concept for the game involved a magic cat making a soup that was so good, it raised the dead. Connecting soup to Halloween proved too abstract, so the team shifted to the idea of a wizard school. 
In keeping with Halloween Doodle Tradition, the team felt it was time to follow the tales of Momo and the Candy Cup Witches with the Ghost‚Äôs side of the story. In the initial concept, Momo dressed up as a ghost for Halloween and fell under the spell of a real ghost. Alas, this spectral romance was better suited for Valentine‚Äôs Day.

On Thursday, October 28th, we’re planning to launch a Champion Fragment event with a new Champion – Vlad the Nightborn. Here’s Plariums opinions on Vlad, and where he’ll be useful. Vlad the Nightborn should be viable in both PvP and PvE battles. Let’s get into his skill set. With A1, he’ll heal himself and decrease the MAX HP of the

A set of strong Steel-type Pokémon like Dialga, Metagross, and Excadril will serve you well when battling Zacian in Pokémon GO.As for the other 5-Star Raid Bosses, all of them are vulnerable to Fairy-type attacks, so powering up a collection of Fairy-type Pokémon such as Enamorus, Xerneas, Gardevoir, Togekiss, Hatterene, and Sylveon is a good idea. 
Stay tuned for details about a special Raid Boss that’ll be available to challenge during our Halloween event! Each week in October, there’ll be a Raid Hour event on Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. local time featuring that week’s Legendary Raid Boss in five-star raids. Pokémon Spotlight Hours 
These events involve battling against a powerful Pokémon called a Raid Boss. Raid Bosses are high-level, powerful Pokémon that appear at Gyms during raids. They have significantly higher CP (Combat Power) than regular wild Pokémon. Raid Bosses can range from basic Pokémon to legendary and even mythical Pokémon, depending on the raid tier  
All Scav bosses, the Goons and the Cultists can be found in every raid at the helicopter on Reserve. They can also still occasionally appear in their usual locations. All bosses have GP coins in their pockets. All bosses, excluding the Goons, are friendly to Scavs regardless of Scav karma. Player Scav cooldown has been reduced regardless of  
What are the Pokémon GO Halloween spawns? Much like the raid bosses for this event, we’re expecting Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon to appear more frequently in the wild. They will also be attracted to Incense and probably Lures, although the special Lures will still attract their respective types of Pokémon. 
Here, you will see the gate where you can start the Halloween Raid. The Halloween Raid consists of an outdoor area and three colored Doors where mobs of enemies spawn.

Trainers, it’s almost the most spooky time of the year, Halloween is coming! As a huge fan of Halloween, and the Halloween events in Pokémon GO, I’m back for my yearly wild speculation article about what we hope to see happen in game this year. Remember, this is wild speculation, and lots of me keeping my fingers crossed. 
The entry of Darkrai and Ghost Pokemon to the game has shaken up the Raid Boss Pool. Players will also be able to encounter Sneasel, Yamask, and Sableye as Tier 2 Raid Boss. Mentioned below is the current raid bosses list. Current Raid Bosses List. Tier 1 – Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Drifloon, Misdreavus, Klink 
The Halloween event consists of a raid every 2 hours and has a challenging ghost boss to defeat. There are 50 waves to complete. Players have to work together to defeat zombie and ghost enemies. A successful victory would take between 15-30 minutes. You will likely receive between 150 and 300 pumpkins for a single win. The event is set to last for 2 weeks. (Started on 27th/28th October  
Raid Bosses with high catch chance (like EX raid Mewtwo) are an excellent opportunity to get more Candy easily. Hunt for Shiny Yamask. Ghost types are not common spawns during day hours, and catching some shiny Ghosts has proven to be a challenge. Use this event to get a shiny Yamask, as we have a feeling it won’t be easy to obtain afterwards. </p>

THE JOY OF CREATION puts you in the shoes of The Creator, a game developer forced to confront the manifestations of his own mind throughout five unique levels, each with a unique blend of free-roaming and classic sit-and-survive gameplay mechanics. This game is officially backed by Scott Cawthon as part of the Fazbear Fanverse Initiative. 
In the meantime, he also released The Joy of Creation: Halloween Edition on October 31, 2016, in which the player is pursued through Fazbear's Fright by "Ignited Springtrap". It differs greatly from Reborn in that it features voice acting and a proper, if simplistic, story with an end goal of burning Fazbear's Fright down to the ground.

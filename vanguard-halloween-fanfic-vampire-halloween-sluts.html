        <p>Kuri: I blame my sudden interest in Diabolik Lovers for this Vampire!Kai image. Plus, it's the month of Halloween. This is dedicated to one of my current favorite CFV fan artists. Otanjoubi Omedettou, Hisuri Rii! Disclaimer: I do not own the anime or even the characters, which both belong to Bushiroad. I do own the plot, though. 
In 1692, a remote village shrouded in dense forests became the stage for a tragic tale. A young maiden named Martha, just 16, saw her innocence shattered when her affection for another girl was discovered. The villagers, gripped by suspicion and superstition, twisted her love into an accusation of witchcraft. 
In the Dream Realm, where harrowing creatures and dead zones exist, Halloween is still being celebrated with festive revelry. This year, Sunless with the request of the nameless sleeper, is hosting a Halloween party for the Firekeepers in his Café, full of mesmerizing decorations, a costume contest, spooky music, and romance. Language: English

Marveling at a Range of Stars. A cop, a jungle girl, a witch, a paleontologist, and an astronaut all sat in a spaceship. No, this is not the setup for a joke. It is the situation Buffy and her friends found themselves in late on Halloween night. (BtVS/Power Rangers/Star Wars/Marvel).

Title: One Hell of a Halloween Rating: R (I think it's PG-13 but I'd rather guess high.) Author: Drake-Tepes Summary: Xander's pick of a Halloween costume leads to one hell of a night. Disclaimer: I don't own any of the characters mentioned in this. The Buffy series characters belong to ME and all those people. 
Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV) Season 6. Episode: s02e06 Halloween (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episode: s02e17 Passion (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episode: s02e21-22 Becoming Parts 1-2 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episode: s06e10 Wrecked. Canon Compliant. It's clear that Buffy didn't come back exactly the same as she'd left them when she leapt from  
No profit or offense intended. This is a work of fanfiction for entertainment purposes and my stress relief only. Notes: My Young Justice: Doom &amp; Rebirth on fanfiction dot net is reaching completion and MHA fic Nemo of the Myriad World will also be released soon. Since it's Halloween, I decided to return to my roots. Chapter 1 
Everywhere she turns, there are low men seeking to steal her virtue and monsters thirsting for her blood. Fear freezes the blood in her veins, almost paralysing her, until help arrives in the form of the soldier, the catwoman, and the vampire. She cowers in fear, but they vow on their honour that this one is a good vampire. 
And Vanguard is one of those stories I really wanted to write a fanfic for. I know I never really said before, but I'm quite an avid Vanguard player, and I watch the anime too. Next is amazing right now. XDXDXD. Anyways, what better way to start a Vanguard story with probably my favorite ship in G right now, Chronoha. 
A Smarter Halloween. Xander Harris shook his head, coming back to reality. He shook it again to knock the wooliness out and make his brain work like he was used to. Dressing up as Harry Potter might not have been his smartest choice ever, even if the plastic glasses and tattered black robe were all he could afford. 
Halloween by Zzilly14 The vampire jumped in front of the redhead. "Boo!" "Xander!" Willow shrieked. "Don't do that!" He took off his mask. "But I love scaring you." "Scare me again, and I won't be Miss Nice Witch anymore." He studied her simple pink dress. "Where's the warts? And the black pointy hat?" "I'm a good witch. Good witches aren't ugly." 
Psyqualia+vampire (I can't believe no one thought of this) "What aichi your transferring!?" ishida naoki practically yelled "quiet down ishida" misaki said in her normal angry voice "yes boss lady" ishida said quietly "don't worry guys I wont be gone for long" aichi said hopefully "the schools called yokai academy doesn't that mean monster?" 
Taking place during season two of Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- and nineteen years after the events of John Carpenter's Halloween -- Michael Myers terrorizes the town of Sunnydale, California and attempts to dispatch The Chosen One.

Halloween. Caroline was throwing a Halloween party at Matt's house so that they could have one day of fun without the usual horror of life in Mystic Falls getting in the way. She had decorated the house perfectly. There were webbed covered skeletons in the corners. Blood red alcoholic punch with floating eyeball ice cubes.

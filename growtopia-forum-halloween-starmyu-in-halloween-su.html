        <p>Check your backpack. There will be a new Halloween item inside. Things to note: -Halloween items will be added even if you do not have enough backpack slots. -Do not drop a stack of splicable items. This will only yield one item. For example, dropping 1 Dirt will give you 1 Candy Corn, but dropping 200 Dirt will still give 1 Candy Corn. 
I made the whole Halloween guide is for them who are new or doesnt know there is a Halloween Event in the game - - - Updated - - -. Synthetic chemical is a chemical, therefore giving it away to the ganoth will reward you a haunted chemical. Thank you for reminded me, i have changed the post and add some additional too. 
Halloween [GUIDE] 10-30-2017, 02:10 AM. Halloween Week is the spookiest week of the Growtopia year! Normally beginning around the actual Halloween, October 31st, these haunted times are sure to put a fright! Sacrifice items to Growganoth, join a cult, and fish for scary creatures! All new stuff is labeled with (new) next to it. 
Halloween Week is a week-long event that usually occurs at the end of October or the start of November. See main article: Growganoth The main portion of the event is located at the special world GROWGANOTH (GROWGANOTH0 - GROWGANOTH200 are also available). In the world, the player can drop items of rarity into the Maw to obtain different Halloween-themed items. Growganoth also accepts a few

How to make profit in halloween and whole growganoth thing? 
Wonder Week 2024 started on October 14, 2024. 
It's too late to invest on rarity 100+ items right now because most of them would drop to 3-5/WL during Halloween. Those include Thingamajigs and Battle trouts, do not buy them! There are people who are probably loading 10-20+ vends with Steam Stomper (rarity 102) and would crash the market for 100+ rarity items. 
Best way to profit in Halloween is to mass produce high rarity items (above 101) and sell them. But it might be a little late for that as most of these items require more than 30 days to grow when you splice them, save for those that require chemicals. 
It's Halloween! Visit the world GROWGANOTH to sacrifice your items to Almighty Growganoth! Growganoth can be found in a total of 14 worlds to prevent overcrowding: Growganoth, Growganoth1, Growganoth 2 until Growganoth150. 
The Gift of Growganoth pack in the store has also been spooked-up and like the normal Halloween items it now gives you the chance to get all the components needed for the Dark King’s Offering from one place, including the rarest component of all, the Spooky Gift. 
Growtopia Gazette: October 19th: Halloween Week! It's time to dust off your cobwebs, light your jack-o'-lanterns, and get ready for a hauntingly good time as Halloween has just started! Go trick-or-treating with your fellow Growtopians and gather as many Halloween Candy as you can while showing off your ghastly, gourd-geous costumes!

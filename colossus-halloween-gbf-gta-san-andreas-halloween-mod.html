        <h2><strong>colossus halloween gbf halloween party announcement ideas</strong></h2>
        <p>An iron giant that bears a burden of deep resentment. Born countless centuries ago from the hands of a subjugated people, it utilizes a bright blade and a suit of the sturdiest armor, all for the sake of opposing the Astrals and eradicating every trace of their existence. After expending an enormous amount of energy, it collapses to its knees and slips into a centuries-long slumber. It awakens  
Colossus (Raid) This article is about the regular raid. For the Impossible Omega III raid, see Colossus Ira Omega (Raid). For the recruitable character, see Colossus. For the Omega summon stone, see Colossus Omega. Colossus is one of the primal bosses of the Phantagrande Skydom islands. It is first encountered in Valtz Duchy.

Colossus is one of the bosses of the main islands. He's first encountered in Valtz Duchy (バルツ公国) and has four different forms: Normal, Hard, Extreme (Magna) and High Level. Every fight against him outside of the story is a Multi-Battle fight. Colossus is one of the six Magnas in the game. To summon him you have to go to Zinkenstill (ザンクティンゼル), the first Island  
Poseidon, Grimnir (Valentine), and Cucouroux (Halloween) hit 9 times due to their guaranteed TA and 3-hit split normal attacks, allowing them to clear the fight on their own. Bowman hits 6 times with his guaranteed triple attack and 3-hit automatic skill activation. With three single-attacking party members, the party will reach 9 hits total. 
Lets say you want to play double Colossus to get 100% critical with your average AES build, this means that you are giving up on the instant Shiva call, while doing crap damage all around because magna fire has no stamina mods before super late in the game and AES base damage is a joke (the HP is nice though), not even Anila + Fire attack buffs

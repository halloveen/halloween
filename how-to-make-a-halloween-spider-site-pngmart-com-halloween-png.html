        <p>Jaimie and Jay make a GIANT SPOOKY SPIDER for Halloween with chicken wire, spray foam, and absolute terror.SUBSCRIBE  GIANT SPIDER DIM 
Pull faux fur around the curved sides of the glued shapes and hot-glue on the underside. Working with one leg at a time, use an awl to poke a hole through the fur into the foam. Place a dab of hot glue on one end of a 12-inch piece of crafts wire and push it about 1 inch into the hole. Repeat for all eight legs. 
26 Gauge Floral Wire. Wire Cutters. Scissors. Instructions: I started by cutting the pool noodle lengthwise into 4 parts. Then I untwisted the wires on the four hangers and straightened them out. I cut the ends off to make the wire the length of each pool noodle. I inserted the ends of each wire into the ends of each pool noodle. 
Step 2: Build the Spine. Cut 8 x 5-inch pipe segments - these will be the struts from the central spine to each leg. Cut 3 x 3-inch pipe segments - these will join each of the vertebrae. Cut 1 x 12-inch pipe segment - this is the "tail" and supports the abdomen of the spider. 
1. Create Milk Jug Body. To begin your giant spider creation, use scissors to cut the spout off of a gallon milk jug (Image 1) and set the lid to the side for later use. Next, use a craft knife to cut a small hole in the center of the bottom of the jug (Image 2). Snake about 4 feet of wire through the hole and out the spout (Image 3).

Attach Eyes and Make Pincers. I added a dab of the sealant to the back of the eyes and stuck them to the front of the spider’s head. Make sure they work with the remote first! For the pincers, I made the two half moon shapes on the black plastic bag I used to protect the floor. Once it was dry, they easily came off. 
Giant Spider Decoration Step 1: Make the Body. Begin by inflating the balloon and the exercise ball. Using duct tape, connect the balloon to the ball to create the spider's body and head. Next  
Attaching the spider legs to the body. 4. Attach the spider legs to the body. Now we're going to the legs onto the exercise ball. Use little tiny pieces of tape and tape the top, bottom, and all of the sides. Make sure they're secure and continue to go and do this. Tidying up the tape. 
On the first spider I created, I used the existing thumb hole. But that required copious amounts of 2-part epoxy putty to fill all the extra space. So on the spider being shown in these steps, I drilled a 1/2-inch hole just above the existing thumb hole, 2 inches deep. This allows a better fit and requires less adhesive to make the union to the

Bend each leg upward about 3 inches away from the board, then downward in 2 more spots to make the shape of the spider's leg. The trick is to make sharp bends rather than gentle curves, to make it look like joints. It doesn't have to be perfect, you can make adjustments later. 
1. How to Make Spider Webs. Before we get started with the list of spider web-themed decorations, we think it would be appropriate if we started out the article with a small tutorial on how to make DIY spider webs from scratch, as this can be extremely useful for those that want to make their own decorations.

No ropes or knots are involved in making this Halloween decoration. Simply stretch and shape the netting to form your spiderweb. Beef netting is waterproof, so you can use it to cover a fence, the side of your house or wherever your imagination takes you. The type of spiders is up to you; go for the store-bought kind or try a DIY spider. 
Here’s how to make spider webs for Halloween: #1 – Use cotton balls. All you need is some good old-fashioned cotton balls and a can of aerosol hairspray to make spider webs that are wispy and lightweight. The larger the cotton balls, the easier the task will be. 
How to Make a Giant Spider Halloween Decoration With just a few pool noodles, some wire, a couple of foam balls, and a little duct tape, you can craft a giant Halloween spider for your front porch. By Beth Huntington Updated Jul 24, 2024 
Use a piece of chalk or white marking pencil to draw the spider web pattern below onto the triangle. I didn’t make a printable since you can make a kirigami spider with any size square of black paper for the paper sheet webs. It doesn’t have to be perfect like those fancy orb webs, we are aiming for the more common house spider web!

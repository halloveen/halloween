Halloween. 93 minutes ‧ R ‧ 1979. Roger Ebert. October 31, 1979. 3 min read. The Shape (later to become better-known as Michael Myers in sequels) suffers from an unhealthy and irrationally vehement fear and loathing of teenage sexuality in "Halloween." “I enjoy playing the audience like a piano.”. 
On a cold Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith. He was sentenced and locked away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being  
Halloween Ends. This is Laurie Strode's last stand. After 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off  
To say the love story between Corey and Allyson is underwritten and unbelievable would be an understatement. It’s just poorly executed in every way. A shocking amount of “Halloween Ends” is poorly executed with clunkier editing, framing, and writing than the other two films, as if the team were hired to make this one as a contractual  
Halloween Ends is a curious and mostly effective mix of slasher antics and dramatically straight-faced themes. It’s a good enough slasher to provoke laughter in some of its grimmer moments  
‘Halloween Ends’ Review: Jamie Lee Curtis Wields the Knife, but David Gordon Green Is the Killer in Silly Trilogy Capper. Laurie Strode faces down her masked nemesis while struggling to  
What We Said About Halloween Kills. Rafael Motamayor gave Halloween Kills a 7/10 for IGN, saying it "suffers from being the second chapter in a trilogy, but it still delivers gory fun, fantastic  
Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode is again imperiled in 'Halloween Ends.'. Forty-four years, 13 movies and innumerable corpses later, it sounds naïve to think “Halloween Ends” will really mark  
Blumhouse/rated R/111 minutes. Directed by David Gordon Green. Written by Paul Bra Logan, Chris Bernier, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green. Produced by Malek Akkad, Jason Blum and Bill Block  
Given the convoluted nonsense of the Halloween franchise, it isn't the strangest thing to happen, but it may ask a bit upfront with its price tag. Retrorealms: Halloween Review – A Thing of Evil. Much like other games in the series, Retrorealms: Halloween involves a sinister plot by an eldritch horror called The Overlord. The Overlord wants  
Jamie Lee Curtis in David Gordon Green’s ‘Halloween Kills’: Film Review | Venice 2021. Michael Myers is once again back in Haddonfield to spread carnage by the light of jack-o’-lanterns in  
At its best, “Halloween” is about a woman dealing with trauma for more than half her life, and only able to exorcise her demon when she faces him again. That sets up a great deal of pressure on the closing scenes, and—other than one nice twist—“Halloween” just doesn’t deliver when it needs to most of all. 
When “Halloween” was released in October 1978, The New York Times didn’t review it. But it wasn’t out of snobbery. Printing press workers were on strike, and nothing was being published  
Halloween Kills Review The second chapter in the new trilogy ups the ante for gory and brutal kills, with some satisfying nods to the 1978 original.

The Halloween franchise is a complicated beast. You’ve got the original timeline, the Thorn timeline, the H20 timeline, the Blumhouse timeline, the Rob Zombie remakes and, finally, the adorably  
With millions of "Perfect!" opinions beating down on you, honestly realizing the mediocrity of Halloween isn't an easy thing to write in a review. The main reason Halloween isn't as great as it's hyped to be is the core story. A juggernaut killer kills. Point blank: it's generic, unoriginal, and just downright boring, even in its time. 
Parents need to know that Halloween is a direct sequel to the iconic same-named 1978 slasher film that ignores every other sequel and reboot (all nine of them). Survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), now a grandmother, has been single-mindedly preparing herself for the day that masked killer Michael Myers would come for her again.

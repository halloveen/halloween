        <h2><strong>why christians don t celebrate halloween hiasan tema halloween</strong></h2>
        <p>Setting aside a day to celebrate evil, darkness, witchcraft, fear, death and the demonic brings disdain to God. Period. A Christian celebrating Halloween would be like a Satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at Christmas while singing, "Happy Birthday, Jesus!" The two just don't go together. 
Many Christians believe that participating in Halloween is a form of involvement in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness, which is forbidden in Scripture: Ephesians 5:7–15. Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. 
Your Reason for Celebrating Halloween (or Not) Matters. Your motive for why you want to celebrate matters. If the intention is to embrace evil or seek attention through a “sexy” costume, then it's not aligned with what God is cheering on. As "Christ Followers,” Christians are called to exemplify love, compassion, respect for others, and  
The word Halloween literally means the evening before All Hallows Day (or All Saint’s Day) celebrated on November 1. Halloween is also the shortened name of Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Evening and All Saint’s Eve which is celebrated on October 31. The origin and meaning of Halloween are derived from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, but  
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
Televangelist Pat Robertson still warns that Halloween is a day when millions of children “celebrate Satan.”. “There’s a longstanding discourse in America about ‘innocents at risk  
Christians should take time to inform the consciences of friends and family with biblical truth regarding God, the Bible, sin, Christ, future judgment, and the hope of eternal life in Jesus Christ for the repentant sinner. There are several different ways Christians will engage in Halloween evangelism. Some will adopt a "No Participation" policy. 
Yes, Christians can, because the blood of Christ has redeemed Halloween. Traditionally, October 31, which is named Halloween or All Hallows’ Eve, has been considered a pagan holiday. On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a  
As believers, we are called to take the light into the darkness, not run away from it. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it” (John 1:5, NLT). Halloween is a night that is celebrated all over the world as a night that glorifies evil and desensitizes children to things that the enemy loves. 
Most Christians agree that a fall or harvest festival is harmless. There's nothing wrong with celebrating the change of weather, indulging in the fruits and treats of the season, and fellowshipping with friends and family around a fire. The controversy lies in celebrating and participating in Halloween festivities as believers. 
Reasons Why Christians Don’t Celebrate Halloween Swirling around Halloween’s fall festivities and trick-or-treating are the not-so-subtle connections to problematic supernatural practices. Despite the distance from its period of origin, Halloween still remains connected to paganism. 
With the origins and the practices of Halloween in mind, here are three reasons why we believe you should consider ditching Halloween from your (and your children’s) lives: 1. God forbids the merging of pagan customs into our lives. 
A Light in the Darkness. When your kids ask why your family doesn’t celebrate Halloween, don’t focus too heavily on the darkness, like its pagan roots and the fact that witchcraft plays  
Due to its decidedly pagan origins, the answer to the question as to whether Christians should celebrate Halloween is a resounding no. The answer to the question as to whether can Christians participate in Halloween activities without compromising their faith is more difficult. 
But he knows some people would argue that even other important dates for Christians also have an evil origin, like Christmas and Easter. However, he focused on what it promotes. “But in reality, why we don’t celebrate Halloween is because not of just the origins but because of what it promotes,” he said. 
1. Should Christians renounce Halloween as “the Devil’s day”? One of the most famous recent examples of Christian interaction with Halloween comes from Pat Robertson, who called Halloween the “festival of the Devil.” As such, he claimed that participating in Halloween is wrong for Christians. 
Others don’t do anything special at all. So why don’t some Christians observe Halloween? Some Christians don’t celebrate Halloween because of its pagan roots and its present-day associations with evil. Most Christians understand that children and families who dress in costumes and go trick-or-treating don’t have ungodly intentions. 
Each year there are Muslims, Jews and Christians in the United States that abstain from celebrating Halloween. According to the National Retail Federation, 42% of the population doesn’t plan on participating in Halloween this year, though of course during a pandemic, not all these people are forgoing the holiday because of religious reasons. 
Here's why some Christians celebrate Halloween and some don't—plus Bible verses to read on October 31. By Ian Palmer and Terri Robertson Updated: Jul 14, 2023. 
Christian Teaching. With more than 2.2 billion adherents, Christianity comprises about 31.50% among all the organized religions in the world. And, based on a CBN News Facebook survey, 87% expressed that Christians should not celebrate Halloween, while 13% believe that there’s no problem celebrating it. </p>

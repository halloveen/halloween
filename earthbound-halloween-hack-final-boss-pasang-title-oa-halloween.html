Earthbound Halloween is a ROM Hack of the original SNES RPG, Earthbound. It relies heavily on the story from the original game, which I recommend completing first if you want to understand many of the references in the hack. This walkthrough uses the default names for the characters, which are as follows: Varik, Paula, Jeff, and Poo.

It is pretty difficult, but not so bad if you use your head. The enemy design is very deliberate. Every enemy and every boss has a specific weakness that you can exploit. Hell, you can negate basically all damage from the final boss with the right preparations. Or use the final boss's power against themselves.

As much as we love all the Halloween and spooky themed CC there is, Teen sims and older often get the most attention when it comes to costumes. This is a common pattern when it comes to CC clothing but it’s understandable when you consider that once a sim enters Teen-hood, their clothing options remain the same for the rest of their lives. 
I also love costume and theme parties in general and would be down for them ALL year round so there is that. Generally, people celebrate Halloween to dress up, watch scary movies, and eat candy So how did we get to costumes and candy? Well according to Google Halloween got its roots from an ancient Celtic festival.

        <p>While The Veil is thinner than normal, a period which lasts from around mid-September until the start of November, it is said to be easier to make contact with the spirits of our ancestors and that the dead can even cross over into the realm of the living more easily and walk among us. The Pagans were aware of this, in fact it is how Halloween  
Halloween, or the ancient Samhain, is considered the time of year when the veil between our world and the spirit world is at its thinnest. As darkness falls and families light their pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, they are, perhaps unknowingly, repeating the ancient traditions of honoring the dead and marking the beginning of the ‘dark half’ of the year. 
The origin of Halloween and many of its customs can be traced to Samhain, an ancient pagan Celtic festival that is Gaelic for “summer’s end,” a day to bid goodbye to warmth and light. It marks the end of the harvest season and the start of winter (the darker “half” of the year). Read Next. The ancient Celts believed that the veil  
“Across cultures, traditions, and places, this is the time of year when the veil between worlds is believed to be thinned,” says astrologer Chani Nicholas, adding that 31 October is also astronomically significant because it marks the midpoint between the September equinox and the December solstice. Such halfway points can’t help but  
The Veil Between Worlds One of the most mystical aspects of Halloween is the belief that during this time, the veil that separates our physical world from the spiritual realm is at its thinnest. 
Halloween's origins trace back to the Celtic celebration of Samhain (pronounced "sou-when") when the veil between the living and the dead was thought to be thinnest and souls passed between realms. What is the earliest observance of Halloween in the USA? The earliest observance of Halloween in the USA was in Hiawatha, Kansas, in 1914. 
The original version or draft of the “Charge of the Goddess” in Wicca was called “ Lift Up the Veil ” in the original Gardnerian Book of Shadows, which stated, “I love you: I yearn for

The leaves begin to change colors; beautiful oranges, reds and yellows against some still-green foliage. The air becomes so crisp and clear with the far-away scent of burning wood as the sky turns dark overhead. Autumn, in all of its burning glory, is upon us. It is the time of Halloween and the thinning of the "Veil Between the Worlds" and  
In medieval Europe, Halloween became associated with witchcraft and divination. The thin veil between worlds was believed to enhance the power of rituals and spells. Witches, wise women, and mystics engaged in practices like scrying, tarot readings, and divining the future to gain insights from the spirit realm. 
During Samhain, the ancient Celtic festival from which Halloween originates, the veil between this world and the next was believed to be at its thinnest and so since the very beginning, Halloween has been an occasion for effective and potent divination a chance to connect with the other side" or get a glimpse into your future.Now you can  
The veil between worlds is thinnest during the crepuscular hours and nautical night, or when The Spirit World is most celebrated in your country, for the United States, that's Halloween. Usually, at places where a lot of energy is being generated or transferred. 
This concept is central to festivals like Samhain, Halloween, and the Day of the Dead, where it's believed that the boundary between the world of the living and the world of spirits becomes thinner. This blog will explore what the thinning of the veil means, how it connects with these celebrations, and offer ways you can honor this time.

However, there are times when the veil thins and communication between the worlds is made easier. In fact, it is said that for one night every year the dead can walk among us. Halloween, as we know it today, is a holiday with deep roots, dating back to a time when the general population was more area of the existence of other worlds. 
The cards are gorgeous (which is, after all, why I bought this set), detailed and the design gives the perfect feeling of autumn/Halloween. The explanations in the book are a bit short at times (the reason why this or that image is associated with this or that aspect is not always clear), but as compensation I learned quite a bit about the history of Halloween, where it really originates, what  
This means that yes, the veil or the natural layer of separation between The Physical World and The Spiritual World is indeed to us closer during the time leading up to Halloween or any other collection of Spirit related festivities, primarily due to collective attraction, given the number of holidays celebrating The Spirit World around this time - over 13 worldwide! 
During Samhain, the ancient Celtic festival from which Halloween originates, the veil between this world and the next was believed to be at its thinnest and so since the very beginning, Halloween has been an occasion for effective and potent divination—a chance to connect with "the other side" or get a glimpse into your future. 
With Halloween festivities abounding, let us also revel in the joy and whimsy this holiday brings. May we celebrate life, death, and all that lies in between with playful abandon and childlike wonder. May this season be one of transformation, growth, and new beginnings. Samhain Blessings to all, and a Happy Halloween! Warmly, Anny . 🎃💀👻 
Veil Between Worlds: Drawing Back the Curtain “The Veil” (sometimes referred to as a doorway, window or gateway) symbolizes a thin, permeable barrier between the material world and the spiritual realm. On one side of this Veil, we experience all of our conscious encounters—-the mundane, every day existence familiar to our waking life. </p>

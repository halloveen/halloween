        <p>While The Veil is thinner than normal, a period which lasts from around mid-September until the start of November, it is said to be easier to make contact with the spirits of our ancestors and that the dead can even cross over into the realm of the living more easily and walk among us. The Pagans were aware of this, in fact it is how Halloween  
Halloween, or the ancient Samhain, is considered the time of year when the veil between our world and the spirit world is at its thinnest. As darkness falls and families light their pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, they are, perhaps unknowingly, repeating the ancient traditions of honoring the dead and marking the beginning of the ‚Äòdark half‚Äô of the year. 
The origin of Halloween and many of its customs can be traced to Samhain, an ancient pagan Celtic festival that is Gaelic for ‚Äúsummer‚Äôs end,‚Äù a day to bid goodbye to warmth and light.

The leaves begin to change colors; beautiful oranges, reds and yellows against some still-green foliage. The air becomes so crisp and clear with the far-away scent of burning wood as the sky turns dark overhead. Autumn, in all of its burning glory, is upon us. It is the time of Halloween and the thinning of the "Veil Between the Worlds" and  
In medieval Europe, Halloween became associated with witchcraft and divination. The thin veil between worlds was believed to enhance the power of rituals and spells. Witches, wise women, and mystics engaged in practices like scrying, tarot readings, and divining the future to gain insights from the spirit realm. 
During Samhain, the ancient Celtic festival from which Halloween originates, the veil between this world and the next was believed to be at its thinnest and so since the very beginning, Halloween has been an occasion for effective and potent divination a chance to connect with the other side" or get a glimpse into your future.Now you can

This concept is central to festivals like Samhain, Halloween, and the Day of the Dead, where it's believed that the boundary between the world of the living and the world of spirits becomes thinner.

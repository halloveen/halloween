Many Wiccans do celebrate the modern Halloween of costumes and candy, but others prefer to celebrate Samhain. Samhain (pronounced “sah-win”) begins on the evening of October 31 and ends on  
The story of Halloween begins over 2,000 years ago with the ancient Celtic people, who lived in what is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France. The Celts followed a pagan religious system led by a class of priests known as the Druids. Their calendar revolved around the agricultural cycles and seasonal changes, with Samhain being  
It was May 13 in the year 609 that Pope Boniface IV declared a celebration called All Saints’ Day, also called All-hallows or All-hallowmas in Middle English; the day before it was thus known as  
Most American Halloween traditions were inherited from Irish and Scottish immigrants. [6] Folklorists have used the name 'Samhain' to refer to Gaelic 'Halloween' customs until the 19th century. [7] Since the later 20th century Celtic neopagans and Wiccans have observed Samhain, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. [8] 
As millions of children and adults celebrate Halloween on October 31, few will be aware of its ancient Celtic roots in the three-day Samhain (pronounced sow-win) festival, an old Celtic pagan celebration. Samhain is also known as Autumn Cross-Quarter, Halloween, All Souls’ Night, Dark Moon, and Feast of the Dead, and it is sometimes referred  
Many of us celebrate Samhain over the course of several days and nights, and these extended observances usually include a series of solo rites as well as ceremonies, feasts, and gatherings with family, friends, and spiritual community. In the northern hemisphere, many Pagans celebrate Samhain from sundown on October 31 through November 1.

In the northern hemisphere, many Pagans celebrate Samhain from sundown on October 31 through November 1. 
What is the true Halloween origin? Still, while Halloween’s origins are Christian, as with many religious occasions, traditions over the years have commingled, and today’s Halloween seems to celebrate not only the departed saints — and souls — but also other customs, from the medieval to the secular. 
Many historians trace the origin of Halloween to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, celebrated over 2,000 years ago. Samhain was a pagan festival that marked the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter, which the Celts believed was a time when the veil between the living and the dead was at its thinnest. 
Several countries celebrate Halloween, and they each put their own unique spin on it. Beloved Halloween symbols such as costumes and jack-o'-lanterns all originate with Samhain, though. Therefore, although celebrating Halloween pagan-style does require a few changes, you're likely to be familiar with the majority of Samhain traditions. 
Many Pagans also celebrate it as the old Celtic New Year (although some mark this at Imbolc). It is also celebrated by non-Pagans who call this festival Halloween . 
“The 31st is somewhat like a New Year’s Eve so for me it makes sense to celebrate it from late on the 31st,” Tor said. Pagan Grimoire explains the Wheel of the Year as a symbol that represents the eight festivals important to many pagans, Wiccans, and witches. 
One of the most familiar Sabbats is what some might consider the Halloween pagan holiday. Of course, there are some significant differences between the Pagan celebration and the commercialized event. But, there are also some traditions the commercialized holiday shares with the way pagans celebrate Halloween today. 
Many Jews observe Yizkor communally four times a year, which is vaguely similar to the observance of Allhallowtide in Christianity, in the sense that prayers are said for both "martyrs and for one's own family". [277] Nevertheless, many American Jews celebrate Halloween, disconnected from its Christian origins. [278] 
Celebrate Halloween Like A Witch: There are many ways to celebrate October 31st, including dressing up, carving pumpkin, eating candy, watching horror flicks, etc. October 31st is Halloween, and it’s a perfect opportunity to celebrate the ancient pagan holiday. Known as Samhain by many pagans, this festival represents the close of one year  
Religious ritual was very important to the pagan Romans. What were the two types of religious festivals? a) public festivals paid for by the state and private festivals celebrated by individuals and families Ob) Spring festivals that celebrated springtime and rituals in the Fall that were believed to guarantee a good harvest c) festivals that celebrated Roman war victories and festivals that  </p>

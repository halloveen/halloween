Tactical Alerts are special Alert missions that feature unique challenges and enemies compared to traditional Alert missions. While Tactical Alerts appear for a limited time like normal alerts, they occupy their own unique mission node within a planet, and disappear only once their designated duration has expired, making them more similar to Events. They were first introduced in Hotfix 14.2.4  
Nights of Naberus is a yearly Halloween-themed event where Daughter celebrates Naberus, an ancient Orokin festival of death, by dressing up for the occasion and selling themed goods. Daughter sells Naberus Treats in exchange for Mother Tokens during Nights of Naberus. To buy all event-exclusive (or at the very least time-exclusive) items at least once, players need 1,950 Mother Tokens. The  
For current event, see Nights of Naberus. Part of WARFRAME's Annual Events, the Halloween Holiday Event runs in October of each year. Starting back in WARFRAME's Closed Beta Updates in 2012, Halloween celebrations have continued to appear each year, bringing themed Tactical Alerts, Warframe Cosmetics and Forum Contests. Currently named Nights of Naberus, the 2022 event is hosted by Daughter in  
So this is my first Halloween on Warframe, and me and my friend jumped into the alert right away. We quickly figured out why red chat had talked about being weak and powerless, but we finished it. Then we did the second run where things get a little bit harder, and although we had some deaths we finished that too and found all the caches. 
It's officially time to celebrate Halloween in Warframe with the game's Hallowed Flame event. The event -- which runs from today until November 1 -- features a special Tactical Event wherein players need to survive against hordes of the Infested in the Origin System.

Halloween is warframe is always so great. Halloween in general is the tits, but you can tell DE love it in particular. Every halloween they just dump all these crazy halloween skins and silly stuff on us. That skull sigil is adorable. Im gonna enjoy sticking that on pretty much every frame.

As title says, the 2 missions where you get the day of the dead sigil and the dread skin is extremely laggy, with random freezes every 10 seconds or so. I'm not even getting any low fps, it hovers around at a nice 160 fps in 1080p;The game just freezes when i enter the mission. 
Something halloween related that came directly from the alert itself.

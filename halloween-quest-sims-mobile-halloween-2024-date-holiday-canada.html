The Sims Mobile is an online mobile gaming experience. This means that your Sims will be interacting with Sims of other players daily. At parties, at work, at events around town; everywhere you turn, you’ll see Sims made by other players. But your Sims aren’t the only ones who can make friends. You can befriend other people playing the game  
Make your Sims be in relationships with each other. Do all quest/llama zoom events as relationship events because the time gets cut in half. Also get other long events done while you sleep or otherwise can't be at your phone, open the quest or llama zoom BEFORE you click the pink check mark, and you save a massive amount of time. </p>

        <p>The first 4 Ju-On films, Ju-On The Curse 1 and 2, and Ju-On The Grudge 1 and 2, are genre masterpieces. Truly horrifying experiences that will stick with you 
The franchise‚Äôs ghostly antagonists, Kayako Saeki and her family, have crawled their way into popular culture. Ju-On has maintained a spooky reputation, but each new installment tends to recycle old plots and scares. For Halloween, we‚Äôll be stepping over the threshold of Japan‚Äôs scariest house, reviewing the films in turn. 
Ju-On, also known as Curse of Grudge, is a Japanese American horror film franchise that includes 13 films and one television series, created by Takashi Shimizu. In 1998 Shimizu would create two short films, Katasumi and 4444444444 while attending the Film School of Tokyo. He would study under Kiyoshi Kurosawa, a legendary horror director with a  
Ju-on: The Grudge: Directed by Takashi Shimizu. With Megumi Okina, Misaki It√¥, Misa Uehara, Yui Ichikawa. A mysterious and vengeful spirit marks and pursues anybody who dares enter the house in which it resides.

Ju-On: The Curse 2 (2000) The Curse 2 is a short and curious sequel that was shot back-to-back with The Curse. 29 minutes out of 76 (nearly half the run time) are taken entirely from The Curse  
Ju-On: The Grudge was remade in the US as The Grudge and then released in the US as just Ju-On. So the American film called Ju-On is actually the film Ju-On: The Grudge and NOT the film Ju-On. This has been a public service announcement. they also had ju-on: the curse 1 and 2. both direct to video in japan.

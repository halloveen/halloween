1. The Merrythought. Trade a basic cat costume for this quick and easy look. Simply, drape some faux greens around your neck like a boa, and throw on a t-shirt that highlights your obsession. SHOP  
Cut off the bottom flaps of the carboard so that your legs can stick through the box. Fold the top flaps in. Hole punch the front 2 corners of the box and the back 2 corners. Using string or rope, make “straps” to hang the box from your shoulders. Make this long enough to rest on your shoulders to hold the box up.

Get an extra-large plastic planter pot – ideally one that is mimicking a terra cotta pot – and cut out the bottom to create a kind of planter skirt. Attach straps to the top of the planter that will suspend it from your shoulders, then tuck fake flowers into the top. A few paper butterflies will complete the look. 
If the beanie is more your style, cut 1.5-inch wide strips of light green crepe paper and 1.75-inch stripes of dark green. Curve the tops into points. Spread a glue stick all over a light green  
The only step left is to grab piles of flowers from the dollar store and hot glue them to the inside of the tub, filling in all the spaces {leave a small space for the arms}, and glue one on to a headband. While you could use any color or a lot of different colors, a monochromatic tone is really cute.

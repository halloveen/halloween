        <p>RetroRealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead is very different there. It’s an old-school 2D 16-bit platformer from developers Wayforward Technologies and publishers Boss Team Games set in the world of the Evil Dead franchise that has released alongside another very similar game set in the Halloween franchise. 
Day One Edition Bonus Purchase your copy of the RetroRealms Double Feature Halloween and Ash vs Evil Dead bundle and receive two additional playable characters Laurie Strode from “Halloween” and Kelly Maxwell from “Ash vs Evil Dead” Each character includes their own play style, story, and achievements to unlock Offer expires on November 17, 2024. 
RetroRealms Double Feature – Halloween and Ash vs the Evil Dead is a long title for a surprisingly long game. It looks beautiful and has some great midi-style music, but is let down by a gameplay loop that simply doesn’t hold up. At $25 per title, it’s also a big ask monetarily if you want to see all eight campaigns. 
Accessing Ash vs. Evil Dead (and Halloween) is done via a first-person hub world designed to resemble a cross between an arcade and a museum. You’ll be granted museum tokens as you progress  
You can get the hub by itself, but the Ash vs Evil Dead or Halloween games are sold separately at $24.99 a piece, or as a bundle at $49.99. More on the opportunities and features of the hub later. 
Secrets, Upgrades, and Unlockables: Discover hidden relics and collectibles. Unlock new power-ups and abilities to enhance your character’s skills, and discover all-new ways play. See where you Stand: With leaderboards for both “Halloween” and “Ash vs Evil Dead” you can see how you stack up against other RetroRealms players.

Now, Malcolm Semmens has posted crossover art that sees Evil Dead's Ash and Halloween's Michael Myers facing off with their signature weapons. 
The Halloween and Ash vs Evil Dead franchises have been turned into 16-bit platformers in RetroRealms, featuring countless hidden collectibles, iconic sights and sounds from the films, and over

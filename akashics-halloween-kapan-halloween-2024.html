        <p>In the Wicca tradition, Halloween is when the “veil” that separates our world from the one beyond is the most transparent. It’s also a great time to dive into your Akashic Records and discover how the experiences from your past lives prevent you from having what you want. What is it you want?

Modern practitioners believe the Akashic records can be accessed through prayer, intuition, and meditation. The Akashic records are a collection of all of the thoughts, events, knowledge, and ideas that mankind has had since the beginning of space and time. The concept of the Akashic records originated with Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophist  
According to Irish mythology, Samhain (like Bealtaine) was a time when the 'doorways' to the Otherworld opened, allowing supernatural beings and the souls of the dead to come into our world; while Bealtaine was a summer festival for the living, Samhain "was essentially a festival for the dead".

Akashic records. In the religion of Theosophy and the spiritual movement called Anthroposophy, the Akashic records are believed by Theosophists to be a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future in terms of all entities and life forms, not just human. 
According to Rae Orth, the word Akasha in Sanskrit means astral light, cosmic space, or ether. It is referenced in Indian philosophy, as a fifth nonphysical realm containing all of a soul's information, she adds. And the concept of Akasha in Christianity, Rae Orth notes, is referred to as "The Book of Life," referenced in Exodus in the Bible  
Halloween, or the ancient Samhain, is considered the time of year when the veil between our world and the spirit world is at its thinnest. As darkness falls and families light their pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, they are, perhaps unknowingly, repeating the ancient traditions of honoring the dead and marking the beginning of the ‘dark half’ of the year. 
Celtic Origins. The origins of Halloween can be traced back all the way to the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain – pronounced ‘sow-in’ in Gaelic language. It was originally an event that marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter in Ireland. The day after, on 1 November, would mark the ancient Celts ’ new year. 
Jeffrey Allen: “Akashic records” is a term that describes how the Universe is organized. It’s where: All information is available from anywhere (because everything is inside of us) We are all connected to everything on a quantum level. Everything overlaps in time and space in a zero point — the center of all atoms, stars, galaxies, etc. 
Each episode will explore an aspect of the Akashics ranging from general information on how to access it, discussions of beings who reside there and how to interact with them, tours of unusual or lesser known areas of the Akashics, healing practices, Akashic meditations, and of course discussions about the Akashic Library and your soul book.

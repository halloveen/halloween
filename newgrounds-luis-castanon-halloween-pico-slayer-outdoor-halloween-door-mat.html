The Perfect Murder is an Adobe Flash animation created by Luis and released on March 25, 2004. Originally created for the Newgrounds Jam 2 [1], the plot follows the main trio of Pico, Darnell, and Nene apparently fighting to the death over a jar of "NG Jam". Acting as sort of a tribute to the Pico series, this short Flash movie incorporates all

Created by Luis, he is a mysterious serial killer who has the unique ability to physically shapeshift his body into any form that he chooses. Since his debut, he has gained a cult following on Newgrounds, instantly becoming a fan favorite character.

        <p>One way to create your DIY Yoshi Halloween Costume is to find a matching set of clothes in Yoshi's iconic green coloring. These can be a shirt and pants, a hoodie and leggings, a dress, or any combination thereof. Next, grab some red, white, and black felt from the craft store. Cut the red and white felt into two large circles, with the red  
Cut the top of the pants straight up 3-4 inches as this part will feed into the bib part of the overalls. Now fold your pants with the backside facing out. Make sure you pull out the butt area to a point as well. Cut around the sides allowing 1 inch of extra fabric as a seam allowance and cutting straight across the bottom pants hem.

How to make Mario and Luigi Costumes DIY: Step 1. Attach the star to the overalls. Just print out a star and tuck it into the overalls pocket.

People have been dressing as this awesome duo since I was a kid. The costumes are easy and can work for toddlers, kids and even adults. 
About Luigi. Like his famous bro, Mario, Luigi‚Äôs been a main character in a ton of classic Nintendo games. His never-ending mission to defeat ghosts, treasures, and foes has been exciting young gamers for decades. In the original Super Mario Bros., he played ‚ÄúPlayer 2,‚Äù assisting Mario in his quest to free the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser  
To make your Mario and Luigi hats you‚Äôll need: White and red hats. Green fabric spray paint. White fabric paint (not spray paint) Freezer stencils with ‚ÄúM‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù pattern (I found mine from Mum of All Trades) Temporary fabric spray glue (to adhere the stencil‚Äìyou‚Äôll never get it ironed on there) A large and small paintbrush.

        <p>Ronald Clark O'Bryan (October 19, 1944 – March 31, 1984), nicknamed The Candy Man and The Man Who Killed Halloween, was an American man convicted of killing his eight-year-old son Timothy (April 5, 1966 – October 31, 1974) on Halloween 1974 with a potassium cyanide -laced Pixy Stix that was ostensibly collected during a trick or treat outing. 
Tragically, by the end of the night, O’Bryan’s 8-year-old son, Timothy, would be more than hurt. At bedtime, the boy collapsed from unbearable stomach pain and, on the way to the hospital, died. Authorities determined that he had ingested cyanide-laced candy. Days later, they arrested O’Bryan for the murder of his son.

Parents everywhere (including mine) were scared their children could wind up with poisoned Halloween candy. The case became known as the "Candyman" or "The Man Who Killed Halloween." 
The horrific death of Timothy O'Bryan would prove to be a singular crime,the only deliberate Halloween poisoning fatality ever documented, said Joel Best, a sociology and criminal justice

Shauna Melinda Howe (July 11, 1981 – October 27, 1992) was an 11-year-old girl from Oil City, Pennsylvania, who was raped and murdered on October 27, 1992. Howe's kidnapping and murder by being thrown from a bridge became a cause célèbre in Pennsylvania, receiving widespread media attention for over a decade. 
On Halloween night, 1974, Ronald O’Bryan took his eight-year-old-son, Timothy, and his daughter, trick-or-treating with some other neighborhood friends near their home in the Deer Park suburb of Houston. Since there was a light rain falling, they only collected candy in a two-block area for half-an-hour before returning home. 
Earlier, Ted took a plea deal and agreed to testify against the O’Brien brothers. 34-year-old James and 39-year-old Timothy pleaded not guilty.

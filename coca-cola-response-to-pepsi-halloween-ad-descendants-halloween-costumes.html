        <h2><strong>coca cola response to pepsi halloween ad toram prizes for halloween hunting event</strong></h2>
        <p>This story is about a cheeky Pepsi Halloween ad that directly referenced its biggest competitor, Coca-Cola. On the left, you can see Pepsi’s hilarious Halloween ad from 2013. On the right side, though, there is a Coke fan’s hilarious response. Apparently, the sky is the limit when it comes to Halloween promotions. 
An ad circulating on social media last week showed a Pepsi can wearing a "Cola-Coca" cape, and so did the doctored-up pro-Coke version.  Coke fan's Halloween response to Pepsi ad goes viral  
3. Social Media Engagement. Pepsi didn’t stop at the ad itself. They leaned into the buzz it created, engaging with users and fueling the conversation. When Coca-Cola responded, it only added to the hype, with both brands taking part in a public debate that social media users loved to follow. 
PepsiCo celebrated scary Halloween with advertising displaying a Pepsi can in a red “Cola-Coca” cape. In addition, the direct poke at rival Coca-Cola carried the text “We wish you a scary Halloween!” Because of this, the advertisement grabs great attention on Facebook and Twitter. Thus promoting an unofficial response from Coca-Cola  
The ad features a Pepsi can or tin enveloped in a red cloak or cape. It sports the misspelled version of Coca-Cola in white (using a play in lettering) that reads as “Cola Coca.”. The backdrop is that of a ravine terrain. The text on the ad states, “We wish you a Scary Halloween!”. The ad probably tries to convey that dressing like (or  
However, the response came from a Coca Cola fan, not Coca Cola themselves or any ad agency. The fan’s image text reads, “Everybody wants to be a hero!”. Of course, this changes the idea that Pepsi isn’t wearing a “scary” cape for Halloween but is trying to be a hero – like Coca Cola. This illustrates two key factors in advertising. 
The 'Everybody Wants To Be A Hero' ad, widely circulated on the internet as a response to Pepsi's 'We Wish You A Scary Halloween' ad, is a brilliant example of creative fan-made content. Although it's most likely not an official Coca-Cola advertisement, this clever retort captures the essence of effective brand rivalry. The ad features the same visual as Pepsi's – a Pepsi can in a Coca-Cola  
October 31, 2022 November 16, 2022. Food &amp; Drink Seasonal. When Pepsi dressed up as Coca-Cola for Halloween. October 31, 2022 November 16, 2022. Halloween is here, and Pepsi made the most of it. 2013 the drinks giant issued an ad showing a can of Pepsi dressed in shiny red cape, a swirling logo, resembling their rivals’, Coca-Cola. 
This (seemingly unofficial) ad posted to 9Gag strikes back quite brilliantly. Though it doesn’t appear to be an ad that Coke or its agencies created, it’s a pretty cool response. 
PepsiCo celebrated scary Halloween with advertising displaying a Pepsi can in a red “Cola-Coca” cape. The direct poke at rival Coca-Cola carried the text “We wish you a scary Halloween  
Tracing Back to the Origins: Cocal-Cola and Pepsi. Coca-Cola and Pepsi were created at almost the same time in the late 19th century (only 7 years apart). Moreover, both were developed from the formulas of two pharmacists: John S. Pemberton came up with Coca-Cola, while Caled Bradham was responsible for Pepsi. The Evolution of Brand Names 
The ad reached this viral status on social media because the Coca-Cola supporters felt the Pepsi can was improved by wearing a Coca-Cola cloak where the Pepsi side felt the opposite. There was so much talk between the two sides about the “Scary Pepsi” ad that Coca-Cola even gave an unofficial response back. 
The company recently released a print ad showing a Pepsi Can wearing a “Cola Coca” cape which carries the text ‘We wish you a scary Halloween!’. The ad went viral and received various responses on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. The promotion was carefully placed and the ‘L’ and ‘C’ of Coca-Cola were interchanged to read it as  
Pepsi's Vending Machine ad was released after Coca-Cola announced that it sold four times as much as Pepsi in 2001. The rival cola brand has some fun with that claim by showing a young boy buy two cans of Coca-Cola from a vending machine only to use them as stilts so he can reach the Pepsi button. 
It gives a lot of exposure to the rival brand in that Coca-Cola actually appears more visibly than Pepsi in the ads. So firmly adopting the position of a challenge brand is also risky in itself. It puts Pepsi in danger of becoming Burger King, which seems to spend most of its marketing energy and budget on trolling McDonald's rather than on  
How Pepsi Spooked Coca-Cola With This Hilarious Halloween Ad Coke fan’s response to the Pepsi ad went viral. 
Marketing document from Suffolk County Community College, 4 pages, The product being sold in this ad is Pepsi soda. This ad is using another soda brand, Coca-Cola, to promote its soda. As Pepsi and Coca-Cola are the two most popular soda brands, they are each other's competition. The ad is Halloween-themed. This ad is re 
For 2013's Halloween, there's an ad on the internet about a Pepsi can with a Coke costume, stating it's “scary”, to which Coca Cola responds with “Everybody wants to be a hero”. So far, so good, but the only reference I have been able to find is both images side by side, with a “via 9GAG.com” legend on the side. 
and beverage companies not only for Pepsi but for Coca-Cola as well. (Coyle, 2013) I think Pepsi did a better job at making sure the ad didn’t have a negative effect on Cola-Coca at all. While Cola-Coca could have cared less about feelings. Fans of these companies have never seen 
8. Pepsi vs Coca-Cola – We Wish You A Scary Halloween. In the everlasting advertising war between Pepsi and Coca-Cola, there must have been one brilliant ad with the Halloween theme that made this list. Back in 2014, Pepsi released a Halloween ad that displayed a Pepsi can wearing a Coca-Cola cape, titled: “We wish you a scary Halloween”. </p>

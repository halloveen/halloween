Owl. Owls are associated with Halloween because they only come out at night and make a spooky sound. Thereâ€™s nothing spooky about this cartoon owl, thoughâ€”heâ€™s as cute as a button. Heâ€™s also easy to draw, which is good news for all of you artistic beginners out there. 
Attach some large branches to the tree. Draw a few smaller branches attached to the larger ones. Draw some owls and add some random thin branch lines. Add a simple house shape. Draw a window with some details on the roof. Add a cat, a pumpkin and a couple of bats. Trace the drawing and the shapes with a black marker. 
Silhouettes. Silhouettes create a dramatic and mysterious effect in your Halloween drawings. To create a silhouette, focus on shapes and outlines rather than details. You can draw spooky figures like witches, cats, or haunted houses without adding any intricate patterns or shading. Step 1: Choose your subject. 
Magical Owls Wearing Halloween Costumes in a Forest. Start by drawing owls with rounded bodies, large eyes, and soft feathers. Dress them in Halloween costumes, such as a witchâ€™s hat, a tiny cape, or a pumpkin outfit. Use a variety of colors to make the costumes stand out, such as purple for a witchâ€™s hat or orange for a pumpkin.

        <p>Samuel Loomis. "Death has come to your little town, sheriff." Dr. Samuel Loomis is a character and one of the protagonists of the Halloween franchise. He first appeared in the original Halloween (1978). Loomis' history is complicated by the fact that the series follows several conflicting continuities. 
Dr. Samuel J. Loomis is a fictional character in the Halloween franchise. A main protagonist of the overall series, Loomis appears on-screen in eight of the thirteen Halloween films (and is mentioned or featured in photographs and audio recordings in others), first appearing in John Carpenter 's original 1978 film. 
Halloween’s reboot timeline is a direct continuation to Carpenter’s 1978 movie, ignoring every single movie that came after it – sequels, retcons, and remakes.Set 40 years after that traumatic Halloween night, David Gordon Green’s Halloween saw Michael Myers escaping again and returning to Haddonfield, and while it also revealed that Loomis passed away years ago, it still found a way  
Halloween tells the story of Michael Myers, who on Halloween night 1963, murdered his older sister when he was just six years old. Michael was then sent to Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, where he stayed for over a decade and became Dr. Sam Loomis’ (Donald Pleasence) patient. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael escaped and returned  
Dr. Samuel James Loomis is a fictional character in the Halloween film series. He is the main protagonist and hero of the 1978 classic Halloween and its many sequels (except from III, H20 and Resurrection). Donald Pleasence plays the character of Dr. Loomis in all five films. Throughout the Halloween franchise, he has become somewhat of a  
Loomis goes to the main gate to telephone the hospital, but Michael appears and nearly attacks Marion while she is waiting in the car. Myers escapes from the Illinois state hospital hijacking the car meant for his court date transfer. He returns to Haddonfield in time for Halloween. Loomis is on Michael's trail for the entire date of October 31. 
Samuel Loomis is a character in the Halloween franchise. He first appeared in the original Halloween. In the movie Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later, a retcon was established which removed Halloween 4, 5 and 6 from continuity. As a result, the biography of this Loomis is drastically different to the one who appears in the previous version. 
By far, the Loomis cameo in Halloween Kills (2021) is the most impressive act in honoring Pleasence. Not only does the makeup and careful lighting sell the recreation, but the movements of  
Halloween Kills made the bold choice of featuring Loomis as part of the sequel's extended 1978 flashback sequence, but instead of mapping Pleasence's face on a stand-in, the role is played by Tom Jones, Jr. If the name Tom Jones, Jr doesn't sound familiar, that's because Halloween Kills' Dr. Loomis is his first acting credit. 
Samuel Loomis. One of the main protagonists of the Halloween film series. Loomis met a six-year-old Michael Myers after he killed his older sister and became his psychiatrist. After Michael escapes to resume his killing spree, Loomis selflessly sets out to stop him. 
Dr. Loomis sure knows how to go from zero to a hundred real quick. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers would bring Michael back to the franchise as he would return to Haddonfield to hunt down  
Halloween is a 2007 American slasher film written, directed, and produced by Rob Zombie.  Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts to  
Halloween Kills had lots of tricks and treats for audiences. One of the best of both worlds was the recreation of fan favorite character, Dr. Samuel Loomis. Dr. Loomis, originally played by Donald

"I met this six year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face and the blackest eyes. The devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realised that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply evil." —Sam Loomis to Leigh Brackett.[src] Dr. Samuel "Sam" Loomis was the psychiatrist of Michael  
Loomis knew Michael Myers like no other, but he wasnt of much help on Halloween night in 1978. Loomis knew Michael would return to Haddonfield, yet he took too long to get there. Loomis even  
Nancy Kyes. Actress: Halloween. Pretty, perky and appealing brunette actress Nancy Kyes had a regrettably brief acting career; she appeared in three excellent features for director John Carpenter in which she acted under the name of Nancy Loomis. She was born on December 19, 1949 in Falls Church, Virginia. Nancy attended high school in Riverside, California and studied theater at Northwestern  
Halloween (advertised as John Carpenter's Halloween) is a 1978 American independent slasher film directed and scored by John Carpenter, who co-wrote it with its producer Debra Hill. It stars Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis (in her film debut), P. J. Soles, and Nancy Loomis. 
After a controversial recasting, Harris was replaced by J.C. Brandy to play Jamie in "Halloween 6." The fabled "Curse of Thorn" (the runic symbol introduced in "Halloween 5") is seen again after a

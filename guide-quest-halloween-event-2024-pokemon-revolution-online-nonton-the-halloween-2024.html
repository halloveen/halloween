The player can access this area by first speaking with the Police Officer NPC directly south of the Murky Town Poke Center, then speaking with Sailor Mirko. After speaking with the officer, Sailor Mirko will offer the option of sailing to Cemetery Island for 1,500, or for free if the player has an active Transit Pass.

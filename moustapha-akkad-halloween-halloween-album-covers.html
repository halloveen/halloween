Farrands described the  
Miramax and Blumhouse would not have been permitted to make this new trilogy had the Akkad‚Äôs not signed off on it. The Halloween franchise rights have been and are still co-owned by Malek (after Moustapha‚Äôs death).

Akkad was there with his daughter to attend a wedding.Akkad was born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1930. Syria was at that time under French rule

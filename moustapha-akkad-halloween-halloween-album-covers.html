Syrian-American Moustapha Akkad produced a series of "Halloween" movies but it was The Lion of the Desert (1980) and The Message (1976), on the history of Islam, into which he poured his heart. It was reportedly difficult for him to make it in Hollywood but no one could deny his talent as a director  
Within Hollywood, Moustapha Akkad was the little-known producer of the “Halloween” horror movie series. But within the Arab American world, he was the famous filmmaker whose movies defied

Remembering The Late Moustapha Akkad 🎃🖤. Remembering the late Moustapha Akkad, who passed away on this day 15 years ago. He was pretty much the driving force behind the Halloween franchise. Without him, we wouldn’t have all the lore of the franchise to talk about today. Keep Resting In Power Mr. Akkad 🙏, 
By. Shafika Mattar. AMMAN, Jordan – Moustapha Akkad, the Syrian-born filmmaker and producer of the “Halloween” horror movie franchise, died Friday from wounds sustained in the triple hotel  
That same year, screenwriter and long-time Halloween fan Daniel Farrands set out to write the sixth entry in the Halloween series. [9] Farrands gave his horror film scripts to the producer of Halloween 5, Ramsey Thomas; impressed by his writing, Thomas set a meeting for Farrands with executive producer Moustapha Akkad. Farrands described the  
Miramax and Blumhouse would not have been permitted to make this new trilogy had the Akkad’s not signed off on it. The Halloween franchise rights have been and are still co-owned by Malek (after Moustapha’s death).

The Strange Death of Moustapha Akkad; Zarqawi and 'Halloween' The ironies and dangers of globalization are tragically epitomized in the death last week of Hollywood director Moustapha Akkad at the Radisson SAS in Amman at the hands of an Iraqi suicide bomber. Akkad was there with his daughter to attend a wedding.Akkad was born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1930. Syria was at that time under French rule

The film marches through the years, providing some fairly interesting behind-the-scenes material: the alternate versions of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (aka Halloween 6), and the controversy over differing Michael Myers masks in Halloween H2O. Proper due is paid to Carpenter's brilliant first film, but nobody ever really comes out and  
Moustapha Akkad (July 1, 1930 – November 11, 2005) was a Syrian-American movie producer and director who was known for producing all the Halloween movies until his death in 2005. He did not produce the first two Rob Zombie remakes. Halloween 9 was cancelled because of his death. Akkad was born on July 1, 1930 in Aleppo, Syria.

Was it wrong of Universal to take Moustapha Akkad's credit away?

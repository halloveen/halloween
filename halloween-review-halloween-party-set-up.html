        <p>Halloween. 93 minutes ‧ R ‧ 1979. Roger Ebert. October 31, 1979. 3 min read. The Shape (later to become better-known as Michael Myers in sequels) suffers from an unhealthy and irrationally vehement fear and loathing of teenage sexuality in "Halloween." “I enjoy playing the audience like a piano.”. 
On a cold Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith. He was sentenced and locked away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being  
Locked up in an institution, Myers manages to escape when his bus transfer goes horribly wrong. Laurie now faces a terrifying showdown when the masked madman returns to Haddonfield, Ill. -- but  
And there are, of course, elements that display Green’s craftsmanship more than, say, Dwight H. Little (director of “Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers”). I’ve heard a number of people say that it’s the best “Halloween” sequel, to which one almost has to laugh at the low height of that bar. 
Halloween. is a faithful, fundamental sequel (and funny too): EW review. Long live Michael Myers, so maybe someone can finally kill him — in a big, funny, scary, squishy, super-meta sequel that  
10. Kutchiki. Feb 9, 2023. In my opinion, Halloween (2018) is a worthy prequel to the part from 1978. Some things the movie does even better, for example the atmosphere in the movie is much darker than in the original movie. I also think the mask is just great, and the character development of lori can be followed up only at the end have the  
Nearly two decades after being committed to a mental institution for killing his stepfather and older sister, Michael Myers breaks out, intent on returning to the town of Haddonfield, Ill. He  
That makes this new “Halloween” an act of fan service disguised as a horror movie. The fact it works as both means that Green (who flirted with the idea of directing the “Suspiria” remake  
eva3si0n. Halloween is one of John Carpenter's best films. One of the best slashers and horror films. The film, which should be targeted by every slasher coming out after. It's hard to overstate Halloween's impact on modern cinema. And all this filmed literally for several tens of thousands of dollars. 
Halloween Review A great sequel that offers thrills, kills, and even plenty of laughs.  The new Halloween is the movie fans of the series have waited 40 years for, a genuinely well-made and  
When “Halloween” was released in October 1978, The New York Times didn’t review it. But it wasn’t out of snobbery. Printing press workers were on strike, and nothing was being published  
Halloween Ends Review. 6. Review scoring. okay. Though full of creative kills and love for the movies that laid the groundwork for it, Halloween Ends sees the franchise stumbling on its way to the  
Parents need to know that Halloween is a direct sequel to the iconic same-named 1978 slasher film that ignores every other sequel and reboot (all nine of them). Survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), now a grandmother, has been single-mindedly preparing herself for the day that masked killer Michael Myers would come for her again.

Halloween Kills Review The second chapter in the new trilogy ups the ante for gory and brutal kills, with some satisfying nods to the 1978 original. 
Halloween Review. Jamie Lee Curtis and David Gordon Green breathe new life in the boogeyman with the best Halloween sequel ever made. By David Crow | September 9, 2018 | 
With millions of "Perfect!" opinions beating down on you, honestly realizing the mediocrity of Halloween isn't an easy thing to write in a review. The main reason Halloween isn't as great as it's hyped to be is the core story. A juggernaut killer kills. Point blank: it's generic, unoriginal, and just downright boring, even in its time. 
My feeling about David Gordon Green’s reboot of “Halloween” in 2018 was that the talented director fundamentally misunderstood what worked about the John Carpenter original, draining the project of actual tension, despite a few solid set pieces. Having seen his follow-up, “Halloween Kills,” I think I was right. 
We can not say enough good things about Halloween Costume's. Com. We purchased all of our outside decorations for Halloween. The packages came super fast and was exactly as described. I would not waste my time at Spirit Halloween. Give Halloween Costume's.com a try. I am sure you will be as happy as we are. </p>

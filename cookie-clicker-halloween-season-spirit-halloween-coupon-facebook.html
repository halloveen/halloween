Halloween season is a seasonal event in Cookie Clicker. It begins on the 24th of October and ends on the 31st. Alternatively, it can also be activated at any time by purchasing the "Ghostly biscuit" switch, which is obtained by unlocking the season switcher, a heavenly upgrade that costs 1,111 heavenly chips. 
Seasons are events that unlock special upgrades and achievements, and alter gameplay. They can be helpful to get achievements that can only be earned in the first run or through Challenge Mode, such as True Neverclick or Speed baking III. The first season introduced was Halloween Season in October 2013, followed by Christmas Season in December 2013, Valentine's Day Season in February 2014  
Seasons are events in Cookie Clicker that are based on holidays and give upgrades (usually as random drops), have unique achievements, and have special effects while staying in those seasons. Seasons will be triggered at certain times based on the system's clock, or forced through the season switcher. The quickest way to get all seasonal  
Halloween Season: Oct. 24th - Oct. 31st. Christmas Season: Dec. 15th - Dec. 31st. Another way for players to access these seasonal events outside of their scheduled appearance is through the prestige mechanic in Cookie Clicker. After the player has baked 1 trillion cookies, they may use the Legacy button to reset their progress and ascend. 
Start in Valentine's day for all of the upgrades. Switch to Christmas to collect every Festive Hat upgrade. When a Cookie Storm starts, switch to Easter and click storm drops until all of the storm drops are gone [4]. Return to Christmas. When the Wrinkler cap is reached, switch to Halloween and pop all wrinklers [5]. 
The Halloween season in Cookie Clicker unlocks special upgrades, achievements, and alters gameplay. It was introduced in October 2013 and can be triggered automatically for a defined period of time around the Halloween holiday. The “Season Switcher” upgrade allows players to change seasons at will for 24 hours. 
To obtain Halloween cookies in Cookie Clicker, follow these steps: 1. Unlock Halloween cookies by meeting specific requirements, typically reaching a specific level or milestone in the game. 2. Click on the Halloween-themed golden cookies that randomly appear on the screen to obtain Halloween cookies. 
What is Halloween in Cookie Clicker? Halloween in Cookie Clicker is a seasonal event that takes place during the Halloween season.

Easter is a seasonal event in Cookie Clicker. The big cookie will have a nest under it during this time (However, the nest does not appear if the "Particles" setting is off). It was added on May 18, 2014, with the 1.0464 update. Since the 1.0466 update, Easter starts automatically and lasts from 7 days before Easter (Palm Sunday) to Easter itself (Resurrection Sunday). 2024 event period: March  
Business Day Season is a seasonal event in the game, added in version 1.0413. This season serves as an April Fools' Day prank, using the business theme as a practical joke. Business day makes several visual and practical changes to the game, including changing the background and adding new effects to gcs. Since version 1.0466, Business Day starts automatically on the 31st of March (29th on  
For achievements in beta versions, see Cookie Clicker Beta. Achievements are badges you earn for achieving certain goals, and each one increases the amount of milk you have (except shadow achievements). They were introduced in version 1.026.

If this post is here for the same reason I went looking right now to find or create it: you might need to restart the game to trigger the "natural" Halloween season. (The wiki doesn't presently say if the game uses local or server time to determine what day it is or what time zone the server is in if the latter. 
The ascension screen is accessed by the Legacy button, which is under the Info button. Although you can ascend as early as you want, it will not give any benefit until you have baked enough cookies. Depending on how many cookies you have baked, you will earn Heavenly Chips and Prestige Levels when ascending (at a 1:1 ratio). Heavenly Chips are used in the Ascension screen to purchase Heavenly  
Wrinklers are twitchy leech-like creatures that, in normal gameplay, only start to appear during the Grandmapocalypse. While they at first appear to reduce CpS (cookies per second), they actually provide a massive boost to cookie production in the long run. There is a 0.01% chance a Shiny Wrinkler will spawn instead of a normal wrinkler. There is a 0.01% chance upon starting the game that all  
To acquire a biscuits, you have to pop the wrinklers during the Grandmapocalypse. Only by killing them you have a chance to obtain them. As simple as that. 
Halloween. Main article: Halloween Season. Halloween Cookies are unlocked randomly during the Halloween season by popping wrinklers. The unlock rate is 5% base and up to 91% depending on achievements, upgrades, dragon auras, heavenly upgrades, pantheon gods, garden plants, and wrinkler type (normal or shiny). </p>

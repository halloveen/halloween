Dr. Sartain : [last words] Say something. Dr. Sartain : [about Laurie and Michael] I would suspect the notion of being a predator or the fear of becoming prey keeps both of them alive. Dr. Sartain : I'm a doctor. Lock your doors. 
The third act of Halloween 2018 is kicked off when police officer Frank Hawkins (Will Patton) comes across Michael Myers and runs him down with his cruiser. When inspecting the body, his companion Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) attacks: after years studying Michael in captivity, the psychiatrist wants to study the killer in the wild.

It is the eleventh installment in the Halloween franchise, picking up forty years after the events of the original film while disregarding the continuity of the previous sequels. Series co-creator John Carpenter serves as a composer, executive producer  
I like to liken Sartain to Dr. Caligari and Michael as being his somnambulist test subject Cesare (from the Robert Wein German Expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari). In that while the villain was a doctor/montebank already, him getting the sleepwalking subject was a matter of opportunity, and then he tries to use him as a killing tool 
Halloween didn’t address Loomis’ fate and only mentioned that he died, leaving one of his students, Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), in charge of Michael Myers’ case. Sartain was nothing like Loomis, and even though he became obsessed with Michael’s story, as Loomis did in the sequels of the first timeline, he was the one who made

Hawkins is the only character in the 2018 Halloween film to be assaulted by a character that is not Michael, as he is hit accidentally by Laurie and attacked repeatedly by Dr. Sartain. Along with Laurie Strode, Lindsey Wallace and Allyson Nelson, Hawkins is one of four characters to survive two encounters with Michael in this timeline. 
Dr. Samuel J.

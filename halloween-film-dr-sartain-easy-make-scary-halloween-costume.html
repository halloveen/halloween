Halloween. (2018 film) Halloween is a 2018 American slasher film directed by David Gordon Green, and co-written by Green, Jeff Fradley and Danny McBride.

Dr. Ranbir Sartain is the secondary antagonist of the 2018 horror film Halloween, which serves as a sequel to the 1978 slasher film classic of the same name and the first installment of the 2018 timeline of John Carpenter's Halloween franchise.

Forty years after the Haddonfield murders in 1978, two journalists, Aaron Korey and Dana Haines, travel to Smith's Grove Sanitarium to interview Michael Myers, who was captured after Dr. Samuel Loomis shot him off of the Doyle house balcony at the end of the movie.

Halloween (2018) Dr. Ranbir Sartain (1954 – October 31, 2018) has been a psychiatrist at Smith's Grove Sanitarium and the new doctor of Michael Myers after Sam Loomis ' death. He was murdered by his own patient during his killing spree on Halloween night. 
Dr. Sartain : [last words] Say something. Dr. Sartain : [about Laurie and Michael] I would suspect the notion of being a predator or the fear of becoming prey keeps both of them alive. Dr. Sartain : I'm a doctor. Lock your doors. 
The third act of Halloween 2018 is kicked off when police officer Frank Hawkins (Will Patton) comes across Michael Myers and runs him down with his cruiser. When inspecting the body, his companion Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) attacks: after years studying Michael in captivity, the psychiatrist wants to study the killer in the wild. 
Ranbir Sartain is a character in the Halloween franchise whose first appearance was in the 2018 film Halloween.

Halloween (2018) is a 2018 American-British slasher film directed by David Gordon Green and written by Green, Jeff Fradley, and Danny McBride. It is the eleventh installment in the Halloween franchise, picking up forty years after the events of the original film while disregarding the continuity of the previous sequels. Series co-creator John Carpenter serves as a composer, executive producer  
I like to liken Sartain to Dr. Caligari and Michael as being his somnambulist test subject Cesare (from the Robert Wein German Expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari). In that while the villain was a doctor/montebank already, him getting the sleepwalking subject was a matter of opportunity, and then he tries to use him as a killing tool 
Halloween didn’t address Loomis’ fate and only mentioned that he died, leaving one of his students, Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), in charge of Michael Myers’ case. Sartain was nothing like Loomis, and even though he became obsessed with Michael’s story, as Loomis did in the sequels of the first timeline, he was the one who made  
Halloween 2018 introduces Dr. Sartain as the man who facilitates Michael's visit with the two podcasters who Mr. Myers ends up killing after he escapes. Later, Sartain insists he accompany Michael as he's transferred by bus to another mental health facility. After the bus crashes and Michel is in the wind, Sartain is shot, and taken to the  
The original Halloween movie from 1978 served as the launchpad for the franchise, followed by Halloween II, continuing the story immediately after the events of the first film.  Dr. Sartain’s

Shortly after, Hawkins runs over Michael Myers with his car and prepares to shoot the killer, killing Myers for good, when Dr. Sartain stops Hawkins by stabbing him in the  
Hawkins is the only character in the 2018 Halloween film to be assaulted by a character that is not Michael, as he is hit accidentally by Laurie and attacked repeatedly by Dr. Sartain. Along with Laurie Strode, Lindsey Wallace and Allyson Nelson, Hawkins is one of four characters to survive two encounters with Michael in this timeline. 
Dr. Samuel J. Loomis is a fictional character in the Halloween franchise.A main protagonist of the overall series, Loomis appears on-screen in eight of the thirteen Halloween films (and is mentioned or featured in photographs and audio recordings in others), first appearing in John Carpenter's original 1978 film.

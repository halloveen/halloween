        <p>Halloween (2007) Comparison between the R-Rated Version and the Unrated Version. Compared to John Carpenter's original from 1978, Rob Zombie's remake is badly disappointing. Zombie takes a lot of time to show Michael's childhood and development, but with a stripping mother, a drinking father and an arrogant sister, he uses an awful lot of  
There are 3 missing scenes with a total length of 10 minutes 9.5 seconds. John Carpenter's iconic horror flick that created the slasher genre does not require any kind of explanation. 7 sequels, 2 remakes and several rip-offs were the result but none of them match up to the original. In 1980, John Carpenter's Halloween premiered on TV in the US. 
Halloween Kills - Michael Myers Survives Tonight. Three years after the mostly well-received Halloween effort by filmmaking duo David Gordon Green and Danny McBride came Halloween Kills, a seamless follow-up to the events of its predecessor. It continues on the same night and Michael Myers just keeps on murdering like a madman. 
Halloween Ends officially receives an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America for "bloody horror violence and gore."After countless sequels and a remake from director Rob Zombie, the long-running slasher franchise decided to return to square one with director David Gordon Green at the helm for 2018's Halloween, a direct sequel to John Carpenter's original film from 1978. 
Commentators: John Carpenter (writer, director), Debra Hill (writer, producer), Jamie Lee Curtis (actress), and some annoying announcer guy who needed to be edited out. Originally Carpenter wanted  
On a cold Halloween night in 1963, six-year-old Michael Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith. He was sentenced and locked away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being transferred for a court date, a 21-year-old Michael Myers steals a car and escapes Smith's Grove. He returns to his quiet hometown of Haddonfield  
Halloween is an American slasher media franchise that consists of thirteen films, as well as novels, comic books, a video game and other merchandise. The films primarily focus on Michael Myers, who was committed to a sanitarium as a child for the murder of his sister, Judith Myers. Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of  
Halloween. (2018 film) Halloween is a 2018 American slasher film directed by David Gordon Green, and co-written by Green, Jeff Fradley and Danny McBride. It is the eleventh installment in the Halloween film series and a sequel to the 1978 film of the same name, while disregarding all previous sequels. [5] The film stars Jamie Lee Curtis who  
Halloween 2. Compared are the uncut Theatrical Version (released by XT Video) and the US-TV Version (aired on AMC). This TV-Version contains more than 20 minutes of alternate or new scenes, further scenes have been removed from the Theatrical Version. By now, only the Theatrical Version can be watched on US-TV because there's no DVD master for  
In 1978, John Carpenter rolled film on a low-budget horror movie featuring a silent, knife-wielding maniac in a spray-painted Captain Kirk mask and changed the entire genre forever. Halloween  
The Movie In 2007, Rob Zombie, who had already thrilled horror fans with two movies about the Fireflies, took the horror classic Halloween and re-interpreted it according to his vision. As in his previous movies curse words were uttered every second and some of his ideas probably disappointed fans of the original. 
0:07:00 Dr. Loomis argues with 2 other doctors about transfering Michael Myers to a minimum-security-sanatorium. Then he briefly visits Michael and tells him that he might fool them. 
The Producer's Cut has its own music, which also differs from the theatrical version. The workprint on the other hand often uses the music from the first installment of the series from 1978. The workprint also has a different color filter, making the entire movie yellowish while the Producer's Cut rather uses white-blueish colors. 
[01:00:13:XX] [00:00:13] Alternative scene WP: The Halloween lettering differs. The workprint shows the 'a' in form of a thorn rune. TV: A fast-cutted, short preview with well-known slashernoise is missing in the WP. 
Comparison between the uncut workprint (title: Halloween - The Homecoming) and the uncut Theatrical Version by Highlight (title: Halloween - Resurrection; FSK 18, rental DVD). The Homecoming-Workprint is pretty similar to the finished Resurrection-cut. There are only little important changes and not a single violence cut in Resurrection. 
About the movie: The seventh part of the Halloween series takes place 20 years after the events of the original. Laurie Strode has a new identity and is the head of an elite school. 
Another film tear: A car is driving through the streets. From one of the speakers, you can hear advertisements for the following Halloween-programme on TV. Subsequently, you can see two children sitting in front of the TV set as well as several other, costumed, children on their Halloween-march. 23 sec. 70 min

The many parts of Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street that were created in the 80s have one thing in common from our point of view: in addition to the many purely German FSK cuts, at least some parts of the series were internationally notorious even then for their alternative cuts. </p>

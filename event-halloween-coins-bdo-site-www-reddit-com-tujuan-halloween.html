So the guide says all event coins work if there is 'coin' in the name. Doesnt work for me, I tried [Event] Golden Troupe Coin + [Event] Halloween Coin + [Event] Golden Imp Coin + Ancient Bronze Coin. Does anyone know which of those coins doesnt work? 
More like months to come as the events keep coming back usually multiple times per year or are at the very least annual events. The game is full of events exactly because of that: It's cheap just activite one of the many already build events for a week or two each downtime. FOMO at it's best (and worst). 
BDO is a big firm and has a lot of resources and ability to move around. Not as much as Big 4 obviously, but they are still an international firm. Also, don't listen to other Students about firms. 
What the Halloween Event Could have Been: F2P Players get the Rotten Pumpkin Head immediately and can participate in events for XP P2P Players get the rotten and restored pumpkin heads immediately and smash pumpkins for Ensouled Pumpkin 
They already have a variety of small and large events planned out, including a Seasonal Event for Halloween/October. The developers addressed the difficulty of the Diablos event, explaining they wanted to show off how powerful monsters can be, and have it be a "symbol" for players to team up and work towards.

it seems that the Oasis Event Ends on Nov 24 th. (Also known as Covid 19 Event) Please check these Event notes from Korea and make your own decision. First the original Event Notes , where we get Oasis Chests, free TRI Gear and Cron Foods and some other things. 
Check out the latest news on Black Desert. 
Wasn’t everything just backed cause of Covid - therefore wrong holidays all the time? they honestly should of have a mega board event with x5-10 when they came back from lockdowns until the next true holiday came around - like Halloween of this year. Same reason Oasis event was dragged out when it was suppose to end like 2 years prior lol. </p>

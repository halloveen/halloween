The wardrobe is lacking and everything just looks dark and manky. Like everyone is wearing half crunchy moldy Our Town costumes that were left backstage for 6 years and forgotten about. And the worst part is it isn't even scary. So it is neither eery, smart, or scary. It's a totally bonkers horror film. 
Dr. Dan Challis. The protagonist of the only anthology film, Dr. Challis is a doctor who has an estranged relationship with his ex-wife and two children. He stumbles upon a greater conspiracy on October 23rd involving a mysterious television ad and the Silver Shamrock Novelties company. Action Survivor: He manages to be quite resourceful in

Halloween 3's bad reception killed the anthology plan but still resulted in one of the most unique horror movies of its era.

Silver Shamrock, also known as Silver Shamrock Novelties, is an evil organization that serve as the main antagonists of Halloween III: Season of the Witch. This strange marketing company developed a cult following due to very successful marketing in the form a near-omnipresent advert and theme tune that appeared throughout the movie. The goal of Silver Shamrock was to sell seemingly harmless  
Michael Myers famously didn't return as the villain of Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, but the iconic slasher does still make a small appearance. When it comes to the world of horror movies, the word Halloween immediately conjures up one image: Michael Myers.

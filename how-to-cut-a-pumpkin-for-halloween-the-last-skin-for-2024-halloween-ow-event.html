3. Insert the point of the knife at an angle. Pick a point about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) to one side of the stem, and insert your knife at about a 45 degree angle. Push your knife through until you've penetrated through the flesh of the pumpkin. You'll only need to push it in an inch or two.

Cut out the design: Make straight cuts into your pumpkin along the lines of your design, removing the pieces and discarding them in the refuse bowl. 
When you're ready to carve, rinse off the pumpkin and use a sturdy knife to cut an opening in the bottom or top. If you go for the top, Scott recommends cutting a round opening with a triangular notch. "Without a notch, it can be hard to fit the lid back in when you're done," Scott says. Then, start scraping. 
Cut along the drawn lines for the lid or bottom opening with a sharp paring knife. If cutting a lid, angle the blade toward the center of the pumpkin to create a ledge that supports the lid. If cutting a bottom, cut straight into the pumpkin. Step 5: Scoop out the seeds and strings from inside the pumpkin. Use a large spoon, ice cream scoop or  
Start cutting. Using the sharpest knife in the house, carefully cut along your design, making sure the hand that's stabilizing the pumpkin is not in the path of the hand wielding the knife. If a piece you've cut doesn't pop out, try pushing it in. (You can retrieve it through the entry hole in back.) 
Draw a circle with about a 2 in (5.1 cm) radius from the stem with a washable marker. Tilt the blade at a 45-degree angle toward the stem and push it into the pumpkin. Saw along your outline with the knife until you can pull the lid off. [2] Cutting at an angle prevents the lid from falling inside of your pumpkin. 
Step 4. Scoop out all the pulp (and then some). OSORIOartist // Getty Images. You can buy a special "claw" for pumpkin gutting, but an ice cream scoop will do just fine. Thin the inner wall of the  
Wipe the outside with a kitchen towel to clean and dry the surface. Transfer the design – Tape the design on the flattest part of the pumpkin. Use a tool that has a needle tip or pushpin to pierce holes through the paper, about ⅛-inches apart. Remove the paper and use a marker to connect the dots. 
Place the pumpkin halves cut-side down on a cutting board and cut off the stems. Turn the halves around and remove the bottoms. Stand the pumpkin halves upright and remove the peel by carefully cutting from top to bottom. 
Baking a pumpkin is as simple as cleaning it, cutting it into chunks, and sticking it in the oven. Heat oven to 325ºF (168°C). Scrub the outside of the pumpkin with a vegetable brush to remove any visible dirt. Cut off the stem, then cut the pumpkin in half (from top to bottom). Use a spoon to scrape out any fibers and seeds out of each half. 
Buying a pumpkin can be intimidating because once you have it, how do you open it? Or cut it?! Or get the skin off?! No worries, Chef Adam will show you how! 
6. Make a Pumpkin Spray . Another way to moisturize the rind is to spray your pumpkin with a peppermint-based conditioning spray. To make this, mix a peppermint soap (we like Dr. Bronner’s Pure Castile Liquid Soap) with a few drops of peppermint essential oil. 
Before we start, you must learn how to cut a pumpkin properly.

It is generally recommended to remove the seeds after cutting the pumpkin in half. Once you have cut the pumpkin, use a spoon or scoop to remove the seeds and the stringy bits from the center. This method allows for easier access to the seeds, and you can save them for roasting or other culinary uses if desired. 
Your instinct might be to cut a hole in the top. But carving a hole in the back of your pumpkin hides the cut and leaves the front of your pumpkin intact and ready for your design. If planning to use a real candle (perhaps a scented fall candle) in the pumpkin, you'll still need to cut a small hole in the top to let the smoke escape. 
This carved pumpkin doubles as both Halloween decor and a candy dish. Simply carve out two holes for eyes and a wide smile for a mouth. Craft eyes out of paper and fill the pumpkin's mouth with your favorite candy. Set outside for trick-or-treaters to enjoy, or keep the candy stash inside for yourself! </p>

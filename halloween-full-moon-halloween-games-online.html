        <p>Learn why a full Moon on Halloween is not common and only happens every 18 to 19 years. Discover the origins of Halloween and the first full Moon after it, as well as the myths and legends associated with this spooky night. 
The Hunter's moon rose on Thursday (Oct. 17), becoming the biggest and brightest full moon of the year and wowing skywatchers around the globe, putting on a spooky Halloween show. 
Halloween falls on a full Moon once every nineteen years, on average. Since the Moon is full about once every 29.5 days, and October is 31 days long, all Halloween full moons are Blue Moons. Carve out a moment to enjoy the Halloween Blue Moon! Lunar views are always a treat. Caela BarryNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.

Learn why the Oct. 31 full moon is a blue moon, a Halloween moon and a micro-moon, and how to watch it live online. Find out the history and meaning of these terms and the last time they happened. 
Today, the phrase “Blue Moon” is commonly used to describe the second full Moon in a calendar month. The Halloween full Moon is a Blue Moon by this modern definition. Past observers have used the same name differently. In a season with four full Moons instead of three, the third full Moon used to be (and sometimes still is) called “blue

It is no different from any other full phase, except for the sentimentality of the date. Because October has 31 days and a lunar cycle occurs every 29.5 days, a Halloween Full Moon means that the month’s first full moon occurs on October 1 or 2, depending on the time of the full phase. It also marks the year’s Harvest Moon (October 1, 2020). 
Sergei Grits, Associated Press. Halloween 2020 is going to be extra special, at least astrologically. For the first Halloween since 1944, nearly all the world’s time zones will experience a full moon. Because of the Metonic Cycle, a full moon appears in some parts of the world — but not most parts — on Halloween every 19 years. 
A full moon on Halloween in ANY time zone is rare enough to begin with. NASA notes that between 1900 and 2100, the moon was or will be full on Halloween just a dozen times.

"In fact, every Halloween full moon is also a blue moon," NASA says. "That's because the cycle of lunar phases (the synodic month) is 29.5 days long, plus or minus a few hours, so any full moon on  
The next Full Moon in 2024 is at 10:34 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, Sept. 17, and is called the Corn Moon. Much of the world will also see a partial lunar eclipse. 
The next full moon on Halloween won't happen until 2039, according to EarthSky. Why such a long wait? Why such a long wait? Full moons on Halloween are rare, writes the Old Farmer's Almanac. 
Unfortunately, trick-or-treaters will have to wait a while before the next full moon on Halloween. According to EarthSky, the next full moon performance to land on Oct. 31 is scheduled for 2039. 
While a blue moon seems rare, a full moon on Halloween across time zones is even more rare – an event that hasn’t occurred since 1944. However, a full moon occurs on Halloween every 19 years

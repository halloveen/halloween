        <h2><strong>halloween doing right saints day guga foods halloween</strong></h2>
        <p>While some people have connected Halloween to earlier pagan celebrations of the new year, Halloween actually has significant Catholic roots. The name itself comes from All Hallow’s Eve – that is, the Vigil of All Saints’ Day, when Catholics remember those who have gone before us to enter our heavenly home. Immediately afterwards, on  
The Triduum of Allhallowtide begins on Halloween on Oct. 31 and concludes with All Souls’ Day on Nov. 2. All Saints’ Day is on Nov. 1. In an episode of EWTN’s “Living Divine Mercy,” Father Chris Alar, MIC, shares the holiday’s historical Catholic roots. 
Halloween's origins can be traced to the Celtic holiday of Samhain, a druidic festival held on October 31. Samhain was the moment when the spiritual world became visible to humans, and the gods  
The word “Halloween”—or “Hallowe’en”—comes from All Hallow’s Eve. All Hallows Eve is the vigil celebration of All Saints Day —also known as All Hallows Day. The word “hallow” means “holy.” (In the Our Father we pray, “Hallowed be thy name.”) All Saints Day is a Holy Day of Obligation, and a major feast on the  
But Halloween also finds a long heritage in the Christian observance of All Saints Day. While the feast day was originally held in March, Pope Gregory III transferred its observance to Nov. 1 in 844. 
Halloween (or “All Hallows Eve”) is the festive precursor to the celebration of the Church’s public commemoration of All Saints Day. There has been an appropriation of the festivities of Halloween by modern pagans, but please understand that modern paganism is precisely modern and should be distinguished from the cults of ancient religions. 
Hallow comes from the same root as holy, and a person who is hallowed is a saint—someone who has been sanctified or made holy. Thus, in the Lord’s Prayer, we say, “Hallowed be thy name.”. If we said that using words derived from Latin, it would be something like “Let your name be sanctified”—i.e., may people treat God’s name as  
The day after Halloween, All Saints Day, is a holy day of obligation. Here in the United States, the celebration of Halloween on October 31st includes trick-or-treating on Halloween night, jack o lanterns, and other activities. For more information on Halloween, including its origins, see these various Catholic Answers resources. 
Pope Gregory III (731-741) dedicated an oratory in the original St. Peter’s Basilica in honor of all the saints on November 1 (at least according to some accounts), and this date then became the official date for the celebration of the feast of All Saints in Rome. St. Bede (d. 735) recorded the celebration of All Saints Day on November 1 in  
Both the feast of All Saints and the feast of All Souls evolved in the life of the Church independently of paganism and Halloween. Let us first address the feast of All Saints. The exact origins  
Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain and is now a worldwide event. Learn more about Halloween's origins, traditions, interesting facts, scary movies and more. 
It is important to keep in mind that All Saints Day is also known as All Hallows Day, Hallowmas or Feast of All Saints in the Christian Church. The day November 1 commemorates all the saints in the church both known and unknown who have attained heaven. So let's dive into the differences between All Hallow's Eve, All Saints Day, and All Souls Day. 
Halloween or Hallowe'en [7] [8] (less commonly known as Allhalloween, [9] All Hallows' Eve, [10] or All Saints' Eve) [11] is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. 
In Italy, Ognissanti (All Saints’ Day) is celebrated on November 1st, followed by Il Giorno dei Morti (All Souls’ Day) on November 2nd. While these days are now firmly part of the Catholic calendar, their origins extend far beyond Christianity, drawing from pre-Christian rituals that honored the dead and marked the transition from autumn to  
It’s downright “scary” how much James Martin, SJ knows about the saints, so who better to explain the connection between Halloween and All Saints Day?In the whimsical video below, BustedHalo.com, an online magazine for spiritual seekers, asked Fr. Martin to explain how these two back-to-back days relate to each other. 
Halloween's origins can be traced to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain.  the Catholic Church established November 1 as All Saints' Day, a day commemorating all the saints of the church  
"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus." (Revelation 14:12)Origin of All Saints Day. The origin of All Saints' Day can be traced back to the early Christian Church when it was established as a day to remember and celebrate the martyrs and other saints who had died for their faith. 
It is a reminder that the saints are not distant figures but part of the great cloud of witnesses that continues to inspire and guide the faithful. All Saints’ Day: Honouring the Saints. On November 1, the Catholic Church celebrates All Saints’ Day, which is a solemnity. 
Traditionally, October 31, which is named Halloween or All Hallows’ Eve, has been considered a pagan holiday. On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a religious feast day

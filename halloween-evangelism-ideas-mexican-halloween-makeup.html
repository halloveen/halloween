        <p>13 Ways to Honor Christ &amp; Love Your Neighbors on Halloween. 1. Just show love. Seems obvious, but sometimes it is important to draw attention to simple ways we can show neighborly love. For instance, make sure your walkway is clean, swept, and well-lit. 
3. Capitalize on Halloweenâ€™s Focus on Death. Another evangelism idea is to capitalize on Halloweenâ€™s focus on death. Decorations, costumes, and movies usually include themes of death, including tombstones, skeletons, and ghosts. Many secular people view Halloween celebrations as a way to make fun of death. 
As you supervise the refreshments, introduce yourself to the parents and make conversation. This could open the door to a new relationship.

Station 1 â€“ Halloween Treats Decoration Challenge @ Church. Station 2 â€“ Costume Dress Up Contest @ Church. Station 3 â€“ Reverse Trick or Treat @ Neighborhood.

These can be quite terrifying, and not all of them may share the right message.) 5. Get to Know Your Neighbors. On a friendlier note, Halloween is also a great time to simply get to know your neighbors. Take your kids trick-or-treating at their houses. Have them trick-or-treat at your house. 
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? Itâ€™s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
Another way to incorporate Christian values into Halloween is to focus on giving to others. Consider participating in a food drive or collecting money for a charity as a family. You could also give out candy with messages of love and hope attached, or consider giving out small gifts or trinkets instead of candy.

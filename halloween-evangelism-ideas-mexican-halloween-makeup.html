        <p>13 Ways to Honor Christ &amp; Love Your Neighbors on Halloween. 1. Just show love. Seems obvious, but sometimes it is important to draw attention to simple ways we can show neighborly love. For instance, make sure your walkway is clean, swept, and well-lit. 
3. Capitalize on Halloween’s Focus on Death. Another evangelism idea is to capitalize on Halloween’s focus on death. Decorations, costumes, and movies usually include themes of death, including tombstones, skeletons, and ghosts. Many secular people view Halloween celebrations as a way to make fun of death. 
As you supervise the refreshments, introduce yourself to the parents and make conversation. This could open the door to a new relationship. We should be gracious to our neighbors because God is gracious to us (Colossians 4:5-6). Be a generous giver, and always be ready to share the gospel on Halloween. 6. 
2. Hold it on Halloween Night. A Fall Festival on a Saturday in October is fine, but don’t think you are providing a light-filled alternative for Halloween. Families will come to your Harvest Festival, but more would come if you planned it for a time when they are looking for their place to trick or treat. 3. 
Organize a Halloween-Themed Amazing Race that starts and ends at your church, but with members and friends going out to round up neighbors in-between. Station 1 – Halloween Treats Decoration Challenge @ Church. Station 2 – Costume Dress Up Contest @ Church. Station 3 – Reverse Trick or Treat @ Neighborhood. 
But individual Christians can take an active role at home on Halloween, tapping in to the flow of children who knock on their door – perhaps only this one time during the year. Kinnaird said alternatives to just handing out candy to trick-or-treaters include gospel tracts. In fact, his three children are looking forward this year to sharing

These can be quite terrifying, and not all of them may share the right message.) 5. Get to Know Your Neighbors. On a friendlier note, Halloween is also a great time to simply get to know your neighbors. Take your kids trick-or-treating at their houses. Have them trick-or-treat at your house. 
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
Another way to incorporate Christian values into Halloween is to focus on giving to others. Consider participating in a food drive or collecting money for a charity as a family. You could also give out candy with messages of love and hope attached, or consider giving out small gifts or trinkets instead of candy. 
4 Evangelism Ideas for Halloween. Sophia Bricker Contributing Writer; Updated Sep 24, 2024; Brought to you by Halloween is a popular holiday in America, both in terms of celebration and economic gain. 
Can ‘Halloween Evangelism’ Be a Big Deal? I’m sure that no one of these tips are game-changers, but if you are endeavoring to life a lifestyle of discipleship and mission, then the next best time to take advantage of this holiday tradition is now. Have fun with it and trust that even small steps relationally are a big deal. 
Here are some ideas for making Halloween witnessing easy and a lot of fun, too! Tracts make great coloring books! Wrap 3 crayons together and include them with a tract in a plastic bag. 
When God Wore a Costume (A Christmas Halloween Lesson) from Me 🙂. Make Pumpkin Carving Meaningful from We Are THAT Family. Great Halloween Gospel Presentation from AWANA and T&amp;T Council Talks.

only give them ideas, but inspire their own creativity in reaching the campus. The 250 is organized by the following topics: Modes of Evangelism: prayer evangelism, ministry evangelism, natural evangelism, and body evangelism. Student Groups: athletes, ethnic students, freshmen, fringe groups, greek students, international students, and men/women. 
Trunk or Treat is an alternative event we make available to our community on Halloween night. Church members come to the church in costume, also decorating the trunks of their cars, and children come to the safe well-lit environment of the church parking lot and proceed from car to car collecting candy.

        <h2><strong>halloween party in regency era wonder woman halloween costume ideas</strong></h2>
        <p>A total of three days (October 31, November 1, and November 2) comprised the holiday: All Hallows’ Eve, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day. This was called Allhallowtide. But the celebrations originated in Celtic rituals on Saimhain (sow-ain) night, marking the end of harvest and the beginning of winter. According to the ancient Celts  
Mimi Matthews October 18, 2015. Snap-Apple Night by Daniel Maclise, 1833. Despite their reputation for straight-laced sobriety, the Victorians celebrated Halloween with great enthusiasm—and often with outright abandon. Victorian Halloween parties were filled with fun, games, and spooky rituals, some of which still feature at Halloween parties  
Check out seven Halloween traditions from the Victorian spooky season. 1. Victorians liked to try and predict their marital status on Halloween. Marriage: The scariest Halloween subject of them  
Nut Crack Night—one of the known Regency customs— was when you would throw two hazelnuts into the fire, one named for you and the other named for the one your heart desires. You would then say the rhyme, “If you hate me spite and fly. If you love me burn awa.”. If the nuts burned side-by-side, he was the one for you. 
As Halloween gained traction among Americans, the Good Housekeeping magazine also described a 1890 Halloween party in pleasurable terms but still different from how we think of Halloween today: “A Halloween party is a pleasant variation from the usual autumn merry-makings in the country. 
Many of the games had origins in pagan religion or medieval superstition. Others were merely a means of making merry with one’s friends. Regardless, Halloween parties of the 19 th century were an occasion for indulging in what author Hugh Miller describes in his 1876 book Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland as: 
It typically begins October 31 and ends Nov. 1. The primary purpose of Samhain is to pay respect for the Dead. Samhain and Halloween are quite different, although the timing is the same. Halloween, or All Hallow's Even, is secular and family-oriented with costumes, spooks and scares, playacting, and trick-or-treating. 
By the late 1800’s Halloween parties became a favorite way to celebrate. Halloween had lost most of its superstitious tone, and games like bobbing for apples and scavenger hunts were popular. Always a bit enchanted by the mysterious, Victorians also indulged in fortune-telling, and games that would predict your future love were also favorites. 
Halloween during the Regency era wasn’t the big to-do like today. It was popular in areas with Celtic origins like Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, but you weren’t likely to be invited to a grand masquerade ball in London. Still, Halloween in Celtic areas was more hiring fairs, bonfires, and fortune-telling games than costume parties. 
The following turn of the century Halloween festivities were taken from two articles in the October 25, 1903 edition of The Sunday Herald of Syracuse, New York. The first article is titled “Halloween: Unique and Ghost-Like Decorations” and is an account of a Halloween party for adults, focusing specifically on the decorations.

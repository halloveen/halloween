Happy Halloween wreath tutorial using Deco Mesh, ribbon and a Halloween sign. Easy to make and supplies are available at  a li 
Bunch up the mesh in your hand and twist the needle ties around the mesh. Do this around the inner circle of the wreath form. The loops should be 10 inches wide and bunch them up as you attach them to the form. As you go around the form, poof out the mesh so it appears thicker between the needle ties. 
Step 1: Cover the metal wreath frame with deco mesh. Begin by loosely attaching 12 pipe cleaners to the wire wreath frame. Six should go on the outer circle of the frame and six on the inner circle. Your frame most likely will have alternating supports between the two circles of the frame. This is a good place to attach each pipe cleaner piece. 
Gather the mesh ribbon in the center and scrunch it together. Attach this new gathered section to the frame by tying the pipe cleaner around it. Repeat every 4-5 inches around the wreath. Ensure the mesh ribbon is fluffed out and spread evenly. Adjust it as necessary to cover gaps and achieve a full look. 
Take one of the lengths of mesh and roll into a tube (not too tight). Hold the tube in one of your hands and pinch and twist between your fingers. Start anywhere on the round wreath form. Bend the tube around a wire, bring the ends together, and secure by twisting a pipe cleaner around the mesh right by the wire. 
Steps for Making a Deco Mesh Halloween Wreath with Sign. Fluff your wreath to make sure it isn’t flat. Cut Deco Mesh in 10 inch long sections. I cut 10 pieces to start and then you can see from there if you need more. Attach the mesh to the wreath using the curl and loop method found in my ebook using the wreath branches to secure. 
Place the work wreath form on a flat surface. Take one bundle of deco mesh and gather the end on the inside ring of the wreath form. Twist two pieces of pipe cleaners around the end to secure it. If you want to use two deco mesh rolls of different colors, use both at the same time. Keep unrolling the deco mesh, move down a few inches, and bunch  
How To Make A Deco Mesh Trick or Treat Halloween Wreath. 1. Add Deco Mesh. Start by attaching the mesh to your work wreath by twisting it to secure it into the pine tines. Make a 10” Pouf with your deco mesh in between each set of pine tines, working along the inner circle first. Continue throughout the entire wreath. 
Attach your 21" deco mesh to wreath form. Start with an 8" poof at the top then work your way around the top of the wreath form attaching a 10" poof at each twist tie. Repeat this process along the bottom rung of the wreath form. Take your 10" mesh and cut 8 20" strips. Curl them slightly at the end and scrunch up the center to make a ruffle.

Ribbon Wreath DIY. Until this year, I have pretty much avoided Deco Mesh Wreaths, Burlap Wreaths and Ribbon Wreaths completely. They just weren’t quite my style. I like modern and simple. A lot of times mesh/burlap/ribbon end up kinda busy. So never one to shy away from a challenge, I decided it was time to try to make a simple ribbon wreath. </p>

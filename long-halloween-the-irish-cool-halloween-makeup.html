Samhain ( pronounced /sow-ween/ in Irish) is the final fire festival of the Celtic year. Between October 31st and November 1st, the harvest season comes to a close and winter is ushered in. The traditions that we use to celebrate Halloween today began thousands of years ago with this ancient Irish high holiday. 
Traditions and customs of Halloween/Samhain. The festival of Samhain, the first day of winter, was marked on the 1 November.

Irish Halloween Traditions. As Christianity spread across Europe, including Ireland, pagan rituals of Samhain died over time. In its place, Halloween became the main festivity although some of the traditions of Samhain remained.

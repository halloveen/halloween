        <h2><strong>trick or treating halloween resensi film grave halloween</strong></h2>
        <p>Trick-or-treating is a traditional Halloween custom for children and adults in some countries. During the evening of Halloween, on October 31, people in costumes travel from house to house, asking for treats with the phrase "trick or treat". The "treat" is some form of confectionery, usually candy /sweets, although in some cultures money is  
One theory suggests that excessive pranks on Halloween led to the widespread adoption of an organized, community-based trick-or-treating tradition in the 1930s. This trend was abruptly curtailed  
Costumed trick-or-treating takes its inspiration from the Celtic holiday Samhain —“summer’s end” in Irish—more than 2,000 years ago. Samhain marked New Year’s Day and fell around  
Trick-or-treating became widespread in the U.S. after World War II, driven by the country's suburbanization that allowed kids to safely travel door to door seeking candy from their neighbors. In  
Halloween does have some pagan roots, but trick-or-treating is one of many aspects of the modern holiday that has medieval Christian roots. 
It was practiced in early 20th century Irish and Scottish immigrant communities, but trick-or-treating didn’t really spread until the 1920s and 1930s, while Halloween pranking raged. According  
Between 1920 and 1950, the centuries-old practice of trick-or-treating was also revived. Trick-or-treating was a relatively inexpensive way for an entire community to share the Halloween celebration. 
In most of the country, Oct. 31 (aka Halloween) is the day to collect your Halloween candy bounty. But in a few areas of the country—such as Des Moines, Iowa—trick-or-treating happens on Beggars' Night, which is Oct. 30. There has been a bit of a movement to shift the Halloween festivities permanently to the nearest Saturday to Halloween  
Trick-or-treating wasn't widely popular in the United States until around 1940, writes Nicholas Roger, author of "Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night." Before then, the mischievous holiday had spiraled into an adolescent free-for-all, marked by rampant vandalism and excessive tomfoolery. 
Best Neighborhoods to Trick-or-Treat Near Atlanta Trick-or-treat in Little Five Points and Candler Park. Little Five Points is known for its funky style, and the cool attitude even extends to the way they celebrate Halloween. The Little Five Points Halloween Festival and Parade has been a neighborhood draw from Atlantans across the metro area  
Trick-or-Treat Around the World. Trick-or-treating today is most common in the United States, with parts of Europe, Canada, and Australia following suit. For countries that don't celebrate Halloween or have trick-or-treating, there seems to be an equivalently joyous celebration in the autumn season that involves going from door to door and  
Then, on Halloween, trick-or-treat in a local area (around your block or within the school zone, for example) and limit the number of homes you visit: Zeltser suggests about five for a first-timer. 
European immigrants to the United States in the 19th century brought Halloween customs with them and helped popularize the holiday. By the 1950s, trick-or-treating for candy had become one of Halloween’s most popular activities, and Halloween is today one of the biggest holidays for candy sales in the U.S.

Earliest Uses of 'Trick or Treat' Still, the trick-or-treating took some time to settle in. The authority on how that term first settled into the lexicon is Barry Popik, an independent etymologist who's also uncovered the mysteries behind such culturally important terms as hot dog and Big Apple. It is he who has found the earliest known

Approximately 35 million children in the U.S. go trick or treating every year. It is estimated that $3 billion is spent on Halloween costumes

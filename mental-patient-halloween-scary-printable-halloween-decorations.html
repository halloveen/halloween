For all the fun that can be had carving pumpkins, eating candy and dressing in costumes, unfortunately October is also a month with Halloween stigma. Typically, horrors involve “haunted asylum” attractions with depictions of residents as violent monsters. In other cases, some stores sell “mental patient” costumes with straitjackets. 
Halloween is a time for thrills, chills and spooky fun—but for some, the holiday can stir up feelings of anxiety or fear. “Fear is a natural response, but context is key,” says Dr. Laura Eddy, therapist at Modern Minds. “Choosing to experience a scare can be fun, but ongoing fear or anxiety that feels uncontrollable [] 
Popular types of mental patient costumes include the straitjacketed escapee, the deranged doctor, and the haunted asylum patient, each rooted in distinct aspects of psychiatric lore.

Halloween decor indoor or outdoor should reflect appropriate harvest or scary themes. Ghosts, witches, goblins, zombies, and the like are all stigma-free—as are pumpkins, cornstalks, and spiderwebs. 4. Decide if the time is right to fight the fight.

Straight Jackets. For around $20 you can have your very own straight jacket this Halloween and dress as a “mental patient”. This decade-old connection with mental illness and straight jackets really needs to fizzle out. In fact, people with high functioning mental illnesses are able to thrive in life personally and professionally. 
Halloween Mental Health Stigma Says Mental Illness Is Scary. If you live with a mental illness, you know that it can be very scary, but not in the fun Halloween sort of way. It is personal torture, a hell that lives only in your mind and uses you against yourself. Straightjackets and asylums don't very accurately convey these constructs though. 
Part of the answer may lie in negative stereotypes of people with mental illnesses as dangerous and unpredictably violent, thus making them “scary.”. Our brain’s natural tendency to confirm

Halloween is an obvious choice for scary movies as it is a spooky time of year. The best Halloween horror movies are not necessarily the scariest or most terrifying as some of them can be considered horror comedies.

I'm 6'4, so between that and the lifts I will wear inside my boots, I will be very tall, but I feel I need an added touch and I believe the mask covers that.

Every year around Halloween we see a recurring rise of haunted asylums, straight jacket “psycho” costumes, and costumes depicting suicide. At MHA, we’ve called for the removal of offensive costumes and attractions, and to draw attention to why these representations are just wrong. They falsely paint people with mental health conditions as violent and scary.

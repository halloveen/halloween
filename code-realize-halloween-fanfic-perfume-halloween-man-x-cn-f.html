A deleted scene from my fanfic series Code: Realize - Children of the Moon starring my OC Zadora and Van Helsing. The Human Weapon is on a mission, to stop the man  
Rated: K+ - English - Romance/Hurt/Comfort - Chapters: 1 - Words: 1,000 - Published: Jan 9, 2021 - [Cardia, Abraham Van-Helsing] Finis - Complete. Code Realized OC by A Star Rewriter. Before Cardia came along, there were these other people in the lives of our boys/men, who became who they are today. Except one. 
Elias is a pretty average guy. He's working to pay of his student loans in a coffee shop, when he meets a girl named Calia that changes his life forever. After meeting her he's flooded with memories of a past life where he is a mysterious man named Saint Germain, and he killed the girl he loved most. 
Follow/Fav. Or Else Let Her Be Mine and Mine Alone By: LizzyLovesPink. Maybe running away and secluding themselves in Wales wasn't the best idea, as Finis starts to slowly realize he's harboring dangerous feelings for Cardia. Feelings she'd never return because of what he'd done to her in the past. 
Quick sketch comic I made for Halloween. Queen Victoria's design is so weird when you think about her real life counterpart. I tried posting this twice already, but the first time I forgot that I had posted yesterday and it hadn't been 24 hours yet and the second time there was like half an hour left or something and I miscalculated. Sorry mods :')

First up, the disclaimer: I do not own anything! Code Realize belongs to her publishers, not to me. Sierra and Mira however are my OC's - Luna belongs to a friend Happydoo2 on DA. Cover Art is By: christon-clivef on deviantart. Story prompt I was given was what would Van's first 'family' Christmas look like - which would also include Mira. 
Code: Realize ~Tangled Web~ Chapter 1. All it took were two heartbeats. The heartbeats felt unfairly spaced out, but she counted them all the same. one. her foot slipped, her balance shifted and the armful of supplies she held scattered in the air as her arms pinwheeled in an attempt to grasp onto anything at all to keep from falling along with

Code:Realize～創世の姫君～ | Code:Realize ~Sousei no Himegimi~ | Code:Realize ~Guardian of Rebirth~ (Anime) (1) Café Enchanté (Visual Novel) (1) Exclude Characters Saint-Germain (Code: Realize) (4) Abraham Van Helsing (Code: Realize) (2) Impey Barbicane (Code: Realize) (2) Reader (1) Mikaze Ai (1) Arsène Lupin (Code: Realize) (1) 
"C-Cardia," stammers Impey, his voice cracking, and only as he attempts to straighten up does he realize that she has flung her arms about his neck. His brain short-circuits so that he can't for the life of him think of how this can be happening, but it doesn't matter. 
OC AU: Silver Lady 4: A couple of months have passed since Code Realize and it is a miserably cold February. Van is working bodyguard and is starting to think about his future, while Sierra on the other hand, is in the mist of political turmoil, fighting desperately to just keep her new life together without worrying the hunter. 
So this is my very first fanfic and I really do love the game. The graphics were amazing and on my first playthrough, I crieda lot.(T T) This is a story that does not happen with any of Lupin's endings, so please do not assume this is part of the game.

The Count was filling us in and-" I hold my hands up to Cardia only to realize they are shaking and I put them down as I clear my throat. "I'm sorry, I am not up to recounting things at this moment. I am not feeling all that well." 
With Cedric still ill, Calista realizes she will not be able to perform with him for the Halloween Ball, but Sofia steps up and doses the show with her in his sted. [Fluf and Friendship within][One-Shot][Halloween 2018] 
Chapter 4: Cardia. Sometime later that night I was outside in Saint's overgrown garden, walking barefoot through the tall grass. Sisi raced to and forth ahead of me, just happy to be outside. </p>

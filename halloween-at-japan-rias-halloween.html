        <p>September 5, 2024. Travel Guides. Halloween continues to grow in popularity in Japan. It burst onto the scene in 2000 when Tokyo Disneyland hosted its first Halloween event. It was a triumph and other theme parks followed suit. Now Halloween is one of the biggest events on the calendar, held, of course, October 31. 
Does Japan celebrate Halloween? Despite being a largely North American tradition, Halloween has been enthusiastically embraced by the Japanese to become one of the country’s largest annual celebrations.

So Halloween is a special chance for everyone to go a little wild, and look a little silly in public! Young people dress in costumes, meet on the streets, and celebrate in appropriately Halloween-y places like the Kawaii Monster Cafe in Harajuku (which goes extra spooky for the holiday). While proper cosplayers might spend months making or  
Halloween at the Shibuya Scramble Crossing is like no other experience.

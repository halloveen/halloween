        <p>September 5, 2024. Travel Guides. Halloween continues to grow in popularity in Japan. It burst onto the scene in 2000 when Tokyo Disneyland hosted its first Halloween event. It was a triumph and other theme parks followed suit. Now Halloween is one of the biggest events on the calendar, held, of course, October 31. 
Does Japan celebrate Halloween? Despite being a largely North American tradition, Halloween has been enthusiastically embraced by the Japanese to become one of the country‚Äôs largest annual celebrations.

Once the parade is over, there is a free after-party at La Cittadella however the due to the Coronavirus, Kawasaki Halloween Parade in 2020 was held online. Admission: ¬•1.000 per person. 
Halloween is increasingly important each year in Japan, with a strong presence in popular culture, and the creation of new culinary traditions. Japanese cuisine may not be quite compatible with Halloween, but many seasonal desserts shaped in Jack O'Lantern üèÆ or other pumpkin-flavored (or artificial pumpkin flavor) candies have been developed  
As Halloween in Japan is also tightly tied with merchants and businesses wanting to profit off it (estimated to be an over 1 million USD market), there is little cultural nuance in it. Especially since Japan already has a similar festival called the Obon festival , which similarly honors the spirits of the dead. 
Halloween in Japan is celebrated beginning on Saturday before October 31, with costumed gatherings in the streets, parks, center squares, or theme parks. Costume parties are a big part of Halloween in Japan, and the celebrations are always tied together with extensive dress-up and plenty of chu-hi or beer. In Tokyo, the districts of Roppongi  
So Halloween is a special chance for everyone to go a little wild, and look a little silly in public!

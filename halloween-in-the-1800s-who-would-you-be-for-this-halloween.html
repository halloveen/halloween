Halloween was also initially thought of as a quaint practice and confined to immigrant communities during the mid-1800s and thought of as being celebrated “amongst the old-style English, Irish, Scotch and Welsh residents.”[2] Furthermore, when mentions of Halloween appeared in the mid-1800s the idea of superstition and love was attached to  
In the late 1800s, common Halloween tricks included placing farmers’ wagons and livestock on barn roofs, uprooting vegetables in backyard gardens and tipping over outhouses. By the early 20th  
In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and witchcraft. At the turn of the  
All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween as it is commonly referred, is a global celebration on October 31. It developed from the ancient Celtic ritual of Samhain, which was, in the simplest terms, a festival celebrating the changing of the seasons from light to dark (summer to winter).

Halloween had its origins in the festival of Samhain among the Celts of ancient Britain and Ireland. On the day corresponding to November 1 on contemporary calendars, the new year was believed to begin. That date was considered the beginning of the winter period, the date on which the herds were returned from pasture and land tenures were renewed. 
And while Halloween has been celebrated in the U.S. since at least the late 1800s, Morton says it really took off in the 1900s after retailers began mass producing Halloween cards, decorations and  
Halloween in the 1800s was not the candy-fueled celebration we know today. Its history stretches back to the times of Celtic druids and Roman conquests, and the foods that Victorian-era Americans enjoyed for Halloween were shaped by ancient European customs. 
Halloween didn’t start as the candy-fueled celebration we know today. In the mid-1800s, Irish families brought Halloween and its associated traditions with them to America. 
Parties and Pranks. In addition to discussions of superstition, Halloween parties and pranks thrived from East to West. Another report from Ironton, Montana, noted that “lads” could be counted upon to organize cabbage-throwing brigades, switch the undertaker’s sign board to the doctor’s office, and put a stuffed donkey at a professor’s desk or a preacher’s pulpit. 
In the late 1800s, since store bought wasn't really an option, people made their own costumes, focusing on the most recognizable symbols of Halloween, like witches or ghosts. Advertisement 
Candy had first made its appearance in the 1800s at American Halloween parties as taffy that children could pull, and candy is now solidified as the go-to “treat.” By the mid 20th century  
Some Halloween traditions in the 19th century: Within a few decades of the wave of Irish immigrants to the United States, Halloween celebrations grew more generally popular. We still have some of the same Halloween rituals today, although others from the 19th century might surprise you. 
Apples, burned nuts and cabbage stalks.

Yes, Halloween was observed in the 19th century. The holiday has ancient roots that date back to Celtic harvest festivals. While not as widely celebrated or commercialized as it is today, Halloween did exist during the 1800s. However, the customs and traditions associated with the holiday were quite different compared to modern times. 
Indeed, these pranks sometimes escalated into more serious crimes such as property damage, some of which led to arrests. In 1898, five lodgers were told to “get out of Geneva as soon as possible” for destroying a sidewalk on Halloween night.

        <p>Community: Every Halloween Episode. Greendale Community College sure knew how to get into the Halloween spirit with the Community Halloween episodes often being highlights of the series. The study group in focus always took an opportunity to attend a campus party, and thankfully for them, their classmates took the spooky holiday seriously. 
Here are all four Community Halloween episodes, ranked from worst to best. 4. “Paranormal Parentage” (Season 4, Episode 2) It’s not overly surprising that the least-liked Community Halloween  
During her pre-Halloween party, Britta gets everyone to tell a spooky story so that she can find out which member of the study group scored out as a psychopath on their psychology profiles. Director Tristram Shapeero Stars Joel McHale Gillian Jacobs Danny Pudi 
Season 4, Episode 2: “Paranormal Parentage”. The first two Community Halloween episodes (Seasons 1 and 2) are definitely the best, with the following two installments (from Seasons 3 and 4) in  
List of episodes. " Epidemiology " is the sixth episode of the second season of the American comedy television series Community, and the 31st episode of the series overall. It originally premiered in the United States on NBC on October 28, 2010 as a special Halloween -themed episode. [ 1 ] In the episode, the Dean throws a Halloween themed  
Epidemiology: Directed by Anthony Hemingway. With Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Yvette Nicole Brown. The study group is left to fend for themselves by Dean Pelton during a rabies outbreak due to tainted food at Greendale's Halloween party. 
Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps (Season 3 – Episode 5) Notable costumes: Abed as Inspector Spacetime, Dean Pelton as the Devil. This Halloween episode breaks from the previous two in the sense that it’s about the gang sitting down and telling each other horror stories. The main purpose of the storytelling is to come up with who tests

Some of the best Halloween episodes happen to come from Community, a stellar television comedy for the ages. While the world waits on a movie, they shouldn't hold their breath for a Halloween-based story. 
In the Community The Complete Third Season DVD commentaries, Gillian Jacobs mentions that she wore a padded bra for the cabin scene with Britta (in a white sweater) and Abed. “I had the lights rigged to flicker because it's Halloween.”— Dean Pelton “It's been happening for a week.”— Jeff “Halloween week!”— Dean Pelton “So the lights will work on November first?”— Jeff  
You might be surprised to learn that beloved sitcom "Community" only produced a few Halloween episodes during its six-season run. Between the various movie spoofs, paintball episodes, Troy and  
Community. No one does Halloween quite like college students. See what we mean by watching these side-splitting Halloween episodes of Community. Community Halloween Episodes: Season 1, Episode 7: Introduction to Statistics; Season 2, Episode 6: Epidemiology; Season 3, Episode 5: Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps; Season 4, Episode 2  
One of my favorite Community episodes. The use of ABBA songs oddly work very well and set the tone of the episode.. Their other Halloween episode, Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps is another great one too. Great episode that lets you see how the group members view each other. 
Say Hello to Peacock! The wildly entertaining new streaming service for watching Community Season 4. Watch today! 
Shirley gets Pierce kicked out the study group, Jeff and Britta plot revenge on a group of high schoolers who make fun of them for attending community college, and Troy helps Abed accomplish some of his movie-clichéd social goals. 
Most of the time, the wackiness of Greendale comes from people just acting weirdly, but this is the closest to sci-fi/fantasy the series ever gets. It’s super weird to remember that, in Community canon, the government wiped the study group’s memories after almost killing them with a zombie-like virus. That feels entirely un-Community. 
Best Halloween Episodes of TV Sitcoms 1. Community Season 2, Episode 6: "Epidemiology". After eating some bad meat from an Army ration surplus shop, the staff and students at Greendale's Halloween  
“Epidemiology,” the season 2 Halloween episode of Community, is a watershed moment for the college-set series, breaking open the sitcom’s world for all the homages and darkest-timeline  </p>

        <p>Murky Town is an event map which firstly opened during Halloween 2017. It can be accessed by talking to Mummy Pharais in various ports, namely Vermilion City, Olivine City, Slateport City and Canalave City, however this required being the Champion of the region the player is in. This brings the player to Murky Town. 
Ghost Rafael [PokeCenter]- 1x Red Halloween Candy, 1x Halloween Candy [Have to battle] Ghost Ronnie- 1x Halloween Candy [Free] Now since we have collected these sweet candies, let's start the quest. To do so, we'll have to talk to. Vice Mayor Butch. He'll tell us that recently, an explorer had discovered that many gems and minerals could be found.

The player can access this area by first speaking with the Police Officer NPC directly south of the Murky Town Poke Center, then speaking with Sailor Mirko. After speaking with the officer, Sailor Mirko will offer the option of sailing to Cemetery Island for 1,500, or for free if the player has an active Transit Pass. 
In order to move forward with the Darkrai quest, you need to complete the first part of the Halloween (quest). It is recommended to have 6 100 Level Pok√©mon in your party, to not struggle against the questline's NPCs. You'll need the following to complete the quest: - Pok√©mon with Miracle Eye. - Pok√©mon with Foresight. 
The sad/unfair thing is you only get 5 pokemon but the good thing is that they counter some pokemon. Some tips. Pokemon that are dying - I suggest you recall them and if HP charge is open use it. If it has enemies keep the pokes in your slots. Charges - It depends on what you choose to do - keep fighting or use a spdef charge to gain, well, spdef.

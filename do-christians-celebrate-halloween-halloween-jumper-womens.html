        <p>Many Christians believe that participating in Halloween is a form of involvement in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness, which is forbidden in Scripture: Ephesians 5:7–15. Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. 
Halloween can be an opportunity to exemplify these teachings, reminding us of our duty to reflect God's light, even in the most unconventional settings. Whether or not you choose to celebrate Halloween, consider how you can leverage any opportunity to advance God’s Kingdom. Use these moments to show the world Jesus in all you do. 
Yes, Christians can, because the blood of Christ has redeemed Halloween. Traditionally, October 31, which is named Halloween or All Hallows’ Eve, has been considered a pagan holiday. On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a  
Halloween’s roots in paganism may raise concerns, but it is the intent of the heart that matters most. As Christians, we must be vigilant not to allow the holiday to glorify or trivialize evil, but rather to celebrate in ways that align with our faith. At the heart of Halloween’s history are themes of death, fear, and the supernatural. 
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
Halloween can be a fun but sometimes tricky holiday for Christians. While it’s often portrayed as a celebration of spooky things, the real meaning behind it is actually pretty cool—Halloween, or “All Hallows’ Eve,” is rooted in Christian tradition as the vigil for All Saints’ Day, a time to honor those who lived faithfully before us. 
Jamie Morgan wrote an article for The Christian Post outlining why she believes Christians should never celebrate Halloween. She highlighted several key points that reflect the views of those who  
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give” (vv. 7-8). “Do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you” (vv. 19b-20). 
The word Halloween literally means the evening before All Hallows Day (or All Saint’s Day) celebrated on November 1. Halloween is also the shortened name of Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Evening and All Saint’s Eve which is celebrated on October 31. The origin and meaning of Halloween are derived from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, but  
Christians should take time to inform the consciences of friends and family with biblical truth regarding God, the Bible, sin, Christ, future judgment, and the hope of eternal life in Jesus Christ for the repentant sinner. There are several different ways Christians will engage in Halloween evangelism. Some will adopt a "No Participation" policy. 
Regardless, the origin of Halloween is certainly in the realm of non-Christian spiritualism. As such, Christians should be careful in their approach to Halloween. Halloween for Christians. Christians haven’t always been sure what to do with this holiday of apparently pagan origins. 
Samhain’s sacrifices morphed into Halloween’s handing out a different kind of offering: candy. Nevertheless, Halloween contains roots in a pagan celebration of death and rebirth. So, should Christians really celebrate Halloween? Christians and Halloween. For many Christian communities, there are three main responses to Halloween. 
Due to its decidedly pagan origins, the answer to the question as to whether Christians should celebrate Halloween is a resounding no. The answer to the question as to whether can Christians participate in Halloween activities without compromising their faith is more difficult. 
For many people, October 31 is an anticipated day to dress up in spooky costumes, go trick-or-treating for candy, and watch horror movies. Despite its popularity, Halloween is controversial for many followers of Christ. Some Christians decide not to celebrate the holiday because of its association  
The choice to celebrate Halloween is yours; through prayer, ask the Lord to help you make a decision that best allows you to honor Him (Colossians 3:23). Dive into Scripture, talk with trusted Christian mentors, leaders, and friends. When you approach Halloween with the desire only to honor God, He will reward you with an answer. 
Many Christians celebrate Halloween. Some churches and pastors even do. I recently saw a church advertising they were having a Zombie Run. Seriously? God's House? This pastor does not celebrate Halloween and neither does her church. 
But, while Halloween has long involved symbols of death and demons, the origins of questioning whether Christians should celebrate Halloween are fairly recent. In fact, it is only in the last half  
Most people don’t understand why Halloween is an issue and aren't dressing up to celebrate evil. But darkness comes in many forms. Here's how to be the light. 
For Christians, Halloween brings a wide variety of responses. Some see no problem with the holiday and celebrate with the normal traditions. Other believers see a huge problem with the association Halloween has with death, darkness, and evil. 
On Oct. 31, millions will celebrate Halloween. But did you know many Christians reject this dark holiday? What are some reasons not to celebrate Halloween? </p>

        <p>Download the DLC Unlocker here! To find the game folder you can do the following: If you're on Steam: If you're on Epic Games: (Ignore the fact the example shows GTA, you can do the same for Payday 2) Then, just extract the zip into the Payday 2 mods folder! If you don't have a mods folder yet, launch Payday 2 once after you've installed SuperBLT. 
EGS. It creates a epic-dlcs-to-unlock.txt file in the mod folder. By default has a "*" in it, which means all dlcs are unlocked. If you want to unlock only specific dlcs, replace the star with dlc names from debug.txt. Dlc ids can be found on Steam DB.

Just because there is an unlimited amount of a certain thing, doesn't make it okay to steal said thing. I've owned Payday 2 on Steam for 6 years and own almost all the DLC, that is a shit ton of money spent on a digital product, but if my account got lost and I wanted to play it again, I would buy it again, since that's just what I consider to be the right thing to do. 
you bought your 20 dollar game, now pay more than 7 times that to get your full experience in other words welcome to payday 2, please enjoy the mountainous amount of stuff you still want to buy. 
Detective Doohickey (Banned) Sep 10, 2016 @ 1:42pm. Skin Unlockers and DLC Unlockers. My Opinion. I have recently gotten into an argument about this. I personally use the Skin Unlocker but not the DLC unlockers. I have purchased all of my DLCs. The person said "You are stealing money from the people who worked on those skins." 
Basically a mod that tells the servers your joining that your using the default kit to hid that you're using DLC-unlocked equipment. Also hides the cheater tag. Personally I buy all DLC the game releases but I'm not stressed about people using that because some want to play the new stuff and just don't have the money. 
The Alesso Heist DLC is the 23rd DLC pack for PAYDAY 2 and is a collaboration with the DJ Alesso. Navigate through the Gensec arena, quiet or loud, and keep the show going while trying to crack Gensec's state of the art exhibition vaults containing loads of cash. 
There aren’t any releases here. You can create a release to package software, along with release notes and links to binary files, for other people to use. 
Since the new update, my dlc unlocker hasnt been working. Ive heard CreamAPI works, but im a newbie when it comes to this type of stuff and i wouldnt know how to find it or operate it haha Share Add a Comment 
Payday 2 Scarface DLC Unlocker. Since the Scarface Character Pack DLC is no longer available for purchase on Steam, the only way to obtain this DLC is from third-party resellers or unlocking the DLC using a script. This is a script that will only unlock the Scarface DLC, this will not affect the DLC that you have already purchased from Steam. 
I installed SuperBLT and copied the mod files(DLC Unlocker) to \Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\mods after launching the game I didn't see any changes. Extract the "dlc-unlocker" folder from the archive to your "mods" folder. 
A heist never tried before Once upon a heist so dreary, while I held my ground, weak and weary,Many a-SWAT came at me, carrying rifles, and pistols galoreWhile I battled, fought the hoard, a sudden pain, I was swiftly flooredA

Since its release in 2013, PAYDAY 2 has had hundreds of updates - adding new heists, playable characters, weapons and other content as well as new game features and improvements. Our vibrant and passionate player community, counting in the millions, has also contributed enormously with suggestions, ideas, and content posted on the steam Workshop. 
PAYDAY 2: 240.6 Maintenance Update. While we’ve been fully focusing on PAYDAY 3, we did get a good opportunity to resolve a few problems in PAYDAY 2. 
Legacy Collection, which contains all the DLC that was made before they "dropped support" for Payday 2 (which they would later go back on when their other projects flopped) regularly drops to about 12-13 USD. 
opened the game and dlc's are locked again. worked like an hour ago but doesnt work now and ive reinstalled them and its still locked. so messed around with what i downloaded a couple hours ago and i believe the problem was is that i updated node.v18 to node.v20, switched it back to v18 and it seems to be working fine as ive been looking through my inventory for a couple minutes now. 
When I saw something (I don't know where) about DLC unlockers saying that if you were to use on of them, you would be labeled a cheater in-game. Out of curiosity, will you be banned from the community as a penalty? Not saying I want to use a DLC unlocker, but once again, I'm curious. Sorry for not searching the topic. </p>

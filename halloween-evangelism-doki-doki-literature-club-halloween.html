        <p>13 Ways to Honor Christ &amp; Love Your Neighbors on Halloween. 1. Just show love. Seems obvious, but sometimes it is important to draw attention to simple ways we can show neighborly love. For instance, make sure your walkway is clean, swept, and well-lit. 
But individual Christians can take an active role at home on Halloween, tapping in to the flow of children who knock on their door – perhaps only this one time during the year. Kinnaird said alternatives to just handing out candy to trick-or-treaters include gospel tracts. In fact, his three children are looking forward this year to sharing  
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
3. Capitalize on Halloween’s Focus on Death. Another evangelism idea is to capitalize on Halloween’s focus on death. Decorations, costumes, and movies usually include themes of death, including tombstones, skeletons, and ghosts. Many secular people view Halloween celebrations as a way to make fun of death. 
Christians should take time to inform the consciences of friends and family with biblical truth regarding God, the Bible, sin, Christ, future judgment, and the hope of eternal life in Jesus Christ for the repentant sinner. There are several different ways Christians will engage in Halloween evangelism. Some will adopt a "No Participation" policy. 
Pray they will be blessed by how you've chosen to bless their children and will be drawn to the light of Christ. Redemption for those involved in witchcraft and demonic influences. Ask God to  
1. Jesus entered our neighborhood in disguise. Two thousand years ago, God himself moved into our neighborhood. He “made his home among us” on earth (John 1:14). He knocked on our doors veiled in flesh, assuming a real human nature. God “sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have” (Rom. 8:3). 
2. Hold it on Halloween Night. A Fall Festival on a Saturday in October is fine, but don’t think you are providing a light-filled alternative for Halloween. Families will come to your Harvest Festival, but more would come if you planned it for a time when they are looking for their place to trick or treat. 3. 
These can be quite terrifying, and not all of them may share the right message.) 5. Get to Know Your Neighbors. On a friendlier note, Halloween is also a great time to simply get to know your neighbors. Take your kids trick-or-treating at their houses. Have them trick-or-treat at your house. 
Halloween as Evangelism. In the end, whether or not an individual or family should celebrate Halloween in any fashion should be carefully considered in relation to their own situation and heart  
4. Use Witnessing Stickers . Instead of distributing gospel tracts, hand out candy bars with witnessing stickers attached. Amazon sells a variety of colorful Halloween stickers, like the Jesus is Light pack. 
SUGGESTED TRACTS FOR HALLOWEEN. When handing out Chick tracts on Halloween, consider the ages of the trick-or-treaters when deciding which tracts to drop in their bags. Some tracts are designed for young children, while others are better suited for older kids and teens. See our recommendations below. 
Halloween is “National Evangelism Day”—it’s the one time of the year that kids come to your door for candyand a tract! This box gives you everything you’ll need to make the most of this amazing opportunity. *Be sure to give candy with your tracts. The box includes: 
Halloween brings outreach opportunities to your front door! Use these effective resources to share the Gospel with trick-or-treaters, at trunk-or-treat events, fall parades, and festivals. All of the tracts and booklets listed below are available in KJV and NKJV versions. Some of our tracts are also available in NIV or Spanish. 
Halloween Evangelism. Many churches host community outreach events on Halloween. They might host a fall festival with food, games, and costume parades. Trunk-or-Treat (Halloween tailgating) is also common, along with bounce houses and more. As a Christian, you can organize your own community outreach event. 
Titles that work best for coloring are "Little Ghost," "Charlie's Ants," "Best Friend," "One Way," and "The Present."Wrap 3 crayons in a rubberband and include them with a tract** in a plastic bag. 
Another evangelism idea is to capitalize on Halloween’s focus on death. Decorations, costumes, and movies usually include themes of death, including tombstones, skeletons, and ghosts. 
Halloween Prayers Evangelism. Love God, love others and share the gospel. That is our calling as Christians and as followers of Christ! He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Mark 16:15 NIV. Halloween provides the biggest opportunity for us to do just that! I mean, seriously! 
In fact, because of the great opportunities we have to share the gospel at this time, our friends at Living Waters refer to Halloween as “National Evangelism Day.” What can you do to advance the gospel of life and light through Jesus Christ this Halloween? Give Gifts and the Gospel </p>

The Film: Halloween III-Season Of The Witch Year Made: 1982 The packaging: 3 Stars. I loved the overall look of the outside packaging. Inside, the disc is easy to pop out, yet stays nice and secure once placed back in the CD holder which is a huge plus. No extras here though on the disc, not even the trailer for the film. </p>

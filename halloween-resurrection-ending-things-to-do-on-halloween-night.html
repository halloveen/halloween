Halloween: Resurrection is a 2002 horror film and the eighth installment in the Halloween franchise, as well as the final entry in the H20 Timeline. Directed by Rick Rosenthal, who had also directed Halloween II (1981), Halloween: Resurrection was then followed by 2007's Halloween reboot. The film opened with the voice-over of Laurie Strode speaking about a 'death tunnel'. As the camera  
Halloween: Resurrection: Directed by Rick Rosenthal. With Jamie Lee Curtis, Brad Loree, Busta Rhymes, Bianca Kajlich. Three years after he last terrorized his sister, Michael Myers confronts her again, before traveling to Haddonfield to deal with the cast and crew of a reality show which is being broadcast from his old home. 
Halloween Ends director breaks down that wild ending. David Gordon Green says he wanted "some note of satisfaction" for the conclusion of Jamie Lee Curtis' final film of the franchise. 
Released on July 12, 2002. For a long time, it marked the final film of the original series as started by Halloween, as Rob Zombie rebooted the franchise in 2007 with a remake of the first film. The franchise would eventually return to the original timeline with a direct sequel to the original film. 
Halloween: Resurrection (previously under working titles of Halloween 8 or Halloween: Homecoming) is a 2002 American slasher film and the eighth installment in the Halloween film series.

Halloween: Resurrection continues with the masked serial killer  
Halloween: Resurrection’s ending leaves a cliffhanger, but all the characters were original and have no connection to Michael. When his eyes snap open in the morgue during the closing scene, it feels like there should be a sequel, but Michael wouldn’t even know who to go after since Laurie dies at beginning of the movie. 
This is a bit of a visual callback to the posters for Halloween 5, Halloween 6, and Halloween: Resurrection. That’s the closest this trilogy ever gets to those movies, really.

Halloween H20 ended about the best possible way the saga of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode could have. Laurie finally won, decapitating Michael with an axe. Jamie Lee Curtis would've been just fine with that conclusion, and was its biggest proponent. 
Halloween: Resurrection Most franchise fans were immensely pleased by the overdue just deserts served at the end of "Halloween H20" (1998). At long last, onetime babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie

The cheapest ending for a horror movie of any sort is the seemingly-dead monster reawakening – the evil isn't as vanquished as the heroes thought. Halloween: Resurrection, reputed as the worst film in the series, ends this way. Michael, charred and burned after being electrocuted, is taken to the morgue. 
Zombie's turn came after the colossal failure of 2002's Halloween: Resurrection,  At the end of H20, Laurie cuts off Michael's head with an ax. There was no coming back from that, except that  
I really like the ending and i am thinking about writing my own Halloween sequel. But just a thought in my head, don't know if i am really going to write my

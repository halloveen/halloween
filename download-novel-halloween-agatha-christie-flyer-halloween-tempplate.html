It was to be a Hallowe’en party for invited guests of an age group between ten and seventeen years old. Mrs. Oliver, removing herself from the main group, leant against a vacant background of wall and held up a large yellow pumpkin, looking at it critically—“The last time I saw one of these,” she said, sweeping back her grey hair from

I thought it would be fun to read a book about Halloween during the Halloween season. So I selected Hallowe’en Party: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie. I was always more of a fan of the Hercule Poirot television series with David Suchet than I was of Christie’s books. After reading Hallowe’en Party, my opinion hasn’t changed. 
A graphic novel was released in 2008, while Hallowe’en Party’s only appearance on TV was in 2009, with David Suchet as Poirot and Zoë Wanamaker resuming her role as Mrs Oliver. Did you know? This is one of the only stories that Agatha Christie uses a child as the murder victim. 
In this captivating novel, Agatha Christie masterfully combines mystery, adventure, and romance, immersing the reader in a world full of secrets, hidden identities, and exotic destinations. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey of suspense and unexpected discoveries. 
Hallowe'en Party stands as a testament to Agatha Christie's enduring legacy, and this dual experience of reading the book and watching the movie offers a delightful immersion into the world of mystery, beauty, and human complexity. 
In the case of Miss Marple, the main books to read in order are ‘A Caribbean Mystery’ and ‘Nemesis’ – ‘Nemesis’ is a follow on novel to ‘A Caribbean Mystery’ and could include spoilers so I really recommend you wait until you read Nemesis if you haven’t yet read the first novel. 
With Halloween just around the corner, I decided to intensify the holiday spirit by diving headfirst into a Halloween-themed novel. Hallowe'en Party by Agatha Christie, intriguingly adapted into a film just last month, emerged as the ideal choice. </p>

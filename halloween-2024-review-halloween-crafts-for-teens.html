It’s that time of year again when Universal Studios Florida transforms into a landscape of nightmares, with fog rolling in and shadows lurking around every corner. Halloween Horror Nights 2024 explores the realms of physical pain and psychological  
Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights 2024 Review We braved the blood, gore, and jump scares to bring you a fresh batch of superlatives from the annual event. By MATT CABRAL 
Slaughter Sinema 2 at Halloween Horror Nights 2024 at Universal Studios Florida. In the six hours that we were at the park, we were able to finish seven of the 10 houses, see the show, walk on three rides, visit with Death Eaters and even try some food. Our first house to walk through was The Museum: Deadly Exhibits. 
September 17, 2024. It’s that time again! Halloween Horror Nights has kicked off their 2024 event at Universal Studios Hollywood! Hollywood has been on a hot streak since coming back from the COVID shutdown in 2020, featuring some of the best haunted houses in recent years, including original features like La Llorona, Monstruos, and Scarecrow  
Retelling the events of A Quiet Place and its sequel, this house immediately earns points for its clever use of sound – or lack thereof. The experience is actually surprisingly loud, but you quickly realize most of the audio – from foreboding chittering to ferocious roars – comes from extraterrestrial “Death Angels” lying in wait.

September 4, 2024. The haunt season has returned! Halloween Horror Nights is back for its 33rd year, promising a line-up of 10 houses, 5 scare zones, and the returning Nightmare Fuel act with an entirely new show.

Joseph Matt September 12, 2024 1 Comment Halloween Horror Nights. Share This! Halloween Horror Nights is BACK! The award-winning Halloween event returns for its 33rd year with more houses and scare zones to scare the spit out of you. This year’s theme is the duality of fear – the Sinister who focuses on graphic horror and Surreal who loves  
This Halloween Horror Nights VIP ticket isn’t cheap, though, costing $359.99 plus tax or more. (Note: 2024 passes not available as of this update.) There are also four passes —Rush of Fear, Frequent Fear, Frequent Fear Plus, and Ultimate Frequent Fear—that grant you access to multiple nights of Halloween Horror Nights. 
UPDATED: August 31, 2024 at 11:21 a.m. Welcome to Orlando, where there is an event that features beheadings, astral projection and puppets in back-to-back-to-back breaths. Yes, Halloween Horror  
Halloween Horror Nights returns this year to Universal Studios Hollywood (Thursday, September 5, 2024) and to Universal Studios Florida (Friday, August 30, 2024) and both events run select nights through Sunday, November 3, 2024. 
Mtn Dew VooDEW 2024. Pros: This is absolutely in contention for being my favorite flavor of VooDEW, rivaling only 2020’s, which I was also a very big fan of. Immediately I am getting a very strong strawberry flavor that tastes incredibly familiar to me.

The spooky season is well underway (at least at Walt Disney World!) and that means it’s Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party time. We were there for the first party of 2024 and will attend a few others before it is over, and we wanted to share our thoughts on whether we think it is worth it or not, plus go over a touring strategy for the evening. 
Welcome to Halloween! Beginning today, as long as you’ve installed the latest 2024.39 software update and 2.15 Rivian mobile app from the App Store, Halloween mode will be unlocked and you’ll be prompted with a screen inviting you to explore all the fun new additions and easter (or maybe pumpkin?) eggs. 
Monstruos: The Monsters of Latin America will also make its debut at Halloween Horror Nights this year. This experience will have you guided by La Muerta. ©Universal. After debuting in Hollywood, this popular house made its way to Orlando for 2024. And we’re glad it did! It had so many large creatures and sets that really took you into the  
Scarowinds 2024 Scarowinds 2024 tickets included with park admission. While there is indeed some new live entertainment at Scarowinds in 2024, the most significant new addition to the event is a  
Also, for those who wish every soda flavor had a zero sugar version, VooDEW 2024 has a zero sugar version, but I’m only going to cover the full sugary version in this review. Right now, I have to say that this might be my favorite VooDEW so far, although every year has been good to great tasting. 
Before we get into it, be sure to check out the FULL list of food that is available at the 2024 events. We’re trying nearly ALL of the new food, so let’s get into it! Photos AND Reviews: ALL the 2024 Fall and Halloween Treats in Disney World!

Don't freak out if you see teens in costume coming to your door—while many say that trick-or-treating should stop by the time a child hits their teen years, in some areas of the country, kids still dress up and seek out candy throughout their high school years. (Because who doesn't want to have a little Halloween fun?) 
The Christian Response to Halloween Today Halloween is almost exclusively an American secular holiday, but many who celebrate have no concept of its religious origins or pagan heritage. That's not to say Halloween has become more wholesome. 
Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31, the evening before All Saints’ Day. The celebration marks the day before the Western Christian feast of All Saints and initiates the season of Allhallowtide. In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious. 
25. I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey. Many people love to watch and sing along to “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” during their Halloween parties. You can use this quote from the show to welcome guests to your Halloween party. 26. It’s Halloween; everyone’s entitled to one good scare. 
If you're all about feeling frightened on Halloween, you probably love all the scary Halloween movies, creepy costumes, and gore that come with the holiday. On the other hand, some aren't as fond of Halloween's spooky side—and that's okay! 
Even if you're not going trick-or-treating, there's bound to be some other eerie entertainment you can enjoy out and about—or something else you can do that gets you out of the house. Many communities host neighborhood-wide parties for everyone to enjoy. Plus, some schools or businesses have Halloween-themed events, too. 
Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light! For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true. Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.

In the 1990s, young French hipsters started to have costume parties for Halloween, and some bars and restaurants took up the trend as well 
110.) What do you get if you cross a witch with ice? A cold spell. 111.) What do owls say when trick or treating? Happy Owl-oween! 112.) What does a panda ghost eat? Bam-BOO! 113.) What do you call a nervous witch? A twitch. 114.) What do you call a fat pumpkin? A plumpkin. 115.) What kind of jewelry do witches wear? Charm bracelets. 116.) </p>

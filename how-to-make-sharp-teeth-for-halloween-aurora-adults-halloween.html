For more secure fangs, add a small "cap" of clay over the teeth directly behind the fangs. 7. Soak the model and fangs in soapy water. Add dish soap into a small bowl of water, then soak the plastic model and clay fangs for 10 minutes. [15] This prevents the alginate from sticking to the clay in the next step. 8. 
Gather all the powder on the edge of the container and add four drops of the liquid. Use the wooden stick to mix the powder and liquid until the mixture achieves a toothpaste-like consistency. Spread the paste onto the walls of the tooth, not down into the cavity. Do this quickly and make sure it’s still a paste and not rubbery. 
Soak the teeth form in water for a few minutes so they won't absorb extra moisture from the bases. Remove from water after a minute and towel off. To cast one base (since it only came with one) mix: 3 tablespoons water. 6 tablespoons UltraCal. Smooth the mixture into the base form. Don't fill the forms entirely. 
These teeth are designed to mimic the sharp, jagged teeth of a werewolf. They can be worn by themselves or paired with a werewolf mask for a truly terrifying costume. With werewolf teeth, you'll be able to unleash your inner beast and scare everyone in sight. Come and check out Costume-Shop.com for a wide range of werewolf teeth. 
Instead of leaving the front and back, cut off one fang on each, leaving a band to wrap around your teeth. If you left both sides, you'd be able to see two different fangs on each tooth. This way, the fang will stay on with the band of straw that wraps behind and the fang will only stick out the front. 
Step by step guide to make a Halloween Teeth In this guide we will explain the steps to make fake fangs for Halloween and how we will attach them to our teeth: Step 1: Create the base to form the structure of the Halloween denture. Using false nails, choose one closest color to your teeth. 
Step 4. Hold an individual acrylic nail in your hand and file it into the shape desired for the tooth. For sharp teeth, file the tooth to a point, but take care that you don't file it down so much it won't fit on the tooth. As you file each individual nail, rinse it in warm water, and then hold it up to your tooth to ensure it works.

Step 1: Making Alginate Impressions. Start by mixing the dental alginate according to the instructions on the packaging.

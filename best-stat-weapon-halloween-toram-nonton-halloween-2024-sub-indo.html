        <p>October 10th, 2019 - November 14th, 2019 October 18th, 2018 - November 15th, 2018 (2019, Updated) Trick or Treat! Halloween Event Chapter 4 released for the first time in 2019 has become playable. The story of Chapter 4 takes place in "Zarth's Mansion", a majestic Western-style house, and involves Jeila and usual trio.[1] (2019) Trick or Treat! Fun Halloween season is drawing near! Prior to  
By repeating the Event Quests you can collect the amount of rewards you want or need. The Event Chapter Bosses also drop the Items directly, the higher the Difficulty the better the chances.

AGI +1 FLEE +1 CSPD +3 ASPD (sometimes +4) per point. DEX +3 ATK +1 MATK +1 HIT +3 CSPD (sometimes +2) per point. DEX every 5 points add +1 ASPD. Conclusion:DEX is the best stat for ATK,it adds ASPD and HIT too. INT is useless. Bowgun. ''Raise DEX to increase physical attack power and accuracy rate. 
This is a simple Katana Guide that everyone can use. Hope you like it. Your primary stat allocation should be DEX&gt;STR (i.g 255&gt;247, which later 375&gt;247 after increasing stat cap after using a certain amount of stat points).This will change entirely depending on the style of the build, or whether you are using DTE (Damage to Element) or NPC Katanas (Orion's Sword, Modestia), which they use STR&gt;DEX. 
Meanwhile, the new content of Halloween Event for 2022 will be added through the maintenance at a later date. Enjoy Halloween earlier in the world of Toram Online! Halloween Event Period. From: 10/6/2022 after the maintenance. Until: 11/10/2022 before the maintenance.

Welcome!! Welcome to Coryn Club, a fansite of Toram Online!. We store a collection of informations from the world of Toram Online. This includes, but not limited to, databases of searchable items, monsters, craftings, skills, and quest. 
Primary Stats Description; STR: Increases critical damage and on most weapons also ATK. INT: Increases MATK and MDEF. There is also a minor increase in MaxMP. On magic weapons it also affects ATK. VIT: Increases DEF and MaxHP. The effect is the same on all weapons. DEX: Increases CSPD and HIT. Many weapons also gain ATK. There is also a minor  
As the fun Halloween season is drawing near, we are bringing back the contents from the Halloween Event held in the past into the world of Toram Online. Meanwhile, the new content of Halloween Event for 2022 will be added through the maintenance at a later date. Check "this news" for details about the new chapter of the Halloween Event. 
Toram Online begins by offering the player six types of weapons. A player is given a choice of Halberd, One-Handed Sword, Bow, Staff, Katana, and Knuckles/Fists at the beginning of the game. As the player ventures further into the game more weapons become available to them. Comes with Blade Skills. Chiefly impacted by DEX, influencing attack speed and damage. STR somewhat increases their  
Craftsman's Sttatting of Weapon -Automatic Version-This is an automatic statting simulator of Weapon. It automatically calculate steps, success rate and material cost of gear statting you want. Initial setting is to simulate statting of the latest level cap. 
Halberd weapons bear the look of the spear one might typically see in other video games as a two-handed weapon or of the like, but they are actually one-handed in this game because you can equip a sub-weapon such as a Dagger. On their lonesome without any skills or buffs, Halberds may deal more damage than the average weapon due to their high base attack. And with those buffs and skills, the  
Stats: STR &gt; AGI Low Lv = low DMG. What's your current Lv? Normal attacks deal low DMG, that's normal. According to your Weapons Stability and your total, basically low Accuracy, DMG may be low, even when crits. Proration? Every attack type's DMG is decreasing by using it continuously. Skills? Skill Lv? Weapon and its Stats? Armor and its Stats? 
Formula used on this calculator is based on the explanation at [Toram Wiki's Status page] and my personal findings. Many thanks to TheXIIIthGuy, Mayam, Ainred, and all other friends who helped with various detailed info. 
This could pair well with Soul Hunter (requires Dark Power Skill book). This stat allocation also works even if you have different sub weapon. Edit: Typos Edit 2: Shield sub weapon offers access to a block skill called P.Defense and manual guard. You won't be needing much HP if you are able to dodge and block hits. 
Mages are the best for low-mid level farming when using Blizzard/Storm. Vortex farmers which are a variant requires crit rate though and are commonly used for high level farming. They gain DTE bonus from INT stat when their weapon have awakened element so their magic damage isn't an issue. 
Idk if it's being solved, because I'm pretty sure Bowgun goes DEX&gt;STR, so you'll remain stagnant at 247 STR or less, thus ~12% stability from stats. Weapon system on toram also doesn't help much, because most new bowguns released follow default 50% stability. Last good craft Bowgun we had above this value was Porcupine Crossbow. </p>

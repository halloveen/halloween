        <p>Halloween: Medieval Christians or Pagan Druids? It’s true that the ancient Celts of Ireland and Britain celebrated a minor festival on Oct. 31 — as they did on the last day of most other months of the year. However, Halloween falls on the last day of October because the Feast of All Saints or “All Hallows” falls on Nov. 1. 
Samhain – Explore more about Samhain. On or around the 31st October in the northern hemisphere, 1st May in the southern, Samhain (Samhuinn) is the festival of the dead, a festival of remembrance and honouring of our dear departed friends and relations. Discover more about Samhain rituals here. 
There, the Druids, who served as Celtic priests, would start a ritual bonfire.  Though modern Halloween deals with graveyards and the walking dead, a focus on one’s own dearly departed is  
According to Irish mythology, Samhain (like Bealtaine) was a time when the 'doorways' to the Otherworld opened, allowing supernatural beings and the souls of the dead to come into our world; while Bealtaine was a summer festival for the living, Samhain "was essentially a festival for the dead". [33] 
Halloween pranks also have a tradition in Samhain, though in the ancient celebration, tricks were typically blamed on fairies. Wicca and Samhain.  In the Druid tradition, Samhain celebrates the  
D ressing up in costumes and trick-or-treating are popular Halloween activities,  History.com notes that Druids, or Celtic priests, thought that “the presence of otherworldly spirits made it  
The druids lit a sacred fire, probably at the new moon (end of Oct/start Nov). Tlachtga was on the horizon from Tara, some 12 miles away, perhaps the Tara fire was lit once the Tlachtga was seen or the fire was brought from Tlachtga to Tara, possibly by boat and Loughcrew (Sliabh na Caillíghe) afterthat. 
Samhain, a word meaning “Summer’s End,” is a Celtic holiday marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of the Celtic New Year on November 1. Originally celebrated among ancient Celts in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland over 2,000 years ago, the celebration was a time of elation and  
Interestingly, druids may have used it as a form of divination in a variety of ways. For example, if a girl successfully bobbed an apple, she would marry over the next year. The apple bobbing became a permanent part of Halloween. Snap Apple Night, a Halloween celebration in County Kerry, Ireland, 1833. Lower right: children bob for apples. 
Tlachtga where the Great Fire Festival at Samhain was celebrated. As millions of children and adults participate in the fun of Halloween on the night of October 31st, few will be aware of its ancient Celtic Druid roots in the Samhuinn (Scotland), Samhain (Ireland (Samain) festival. The oldest graves in Ireland yet found are dated to 7,000 BC  
On 31 October, we celebrate the holiday known as Halloween. Although the revelries and observances of this day primarily occur in regions of the Western world, it has become an increasingly popular tradition across the globe, especially in Eastern Europe and in Asian countries such as Japan and China. 
Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2024 will occur on Thursday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people  
The history of Halloween goes back thousands of years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain.It was celebrated halfway between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, it started on October 31st at dusk, and probably went for three days. 
The ancient Celts took Halloween so seriously it's scary, says Sharron Uhler,  More cheerful is the theory that Druids offered banquets on the Druid’s New Year’s Eve, Oct. 31, for the  
(Chamberlain) "This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated with human death" (The History Channel Exhibits- History of Halloween) It is most likely this reason that the Druids (Celtic pagans) believed that the spirits of those who died the preceding year  
Carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and wearing scary costumes are some of the time-honored traditions of Halloween. Yet, the Halloween holiday has its roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced "SAH-win"), a pagan religious celebration to welcome the harvest at the end of summer, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. 
Halloween's origins can be traced to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Over the centuries, Halloween evolved, taking on Christian influences, European myth and American consumerism. 
Halloween has its roots in Samhain, but they are not the same thing. Halloween has become a children’s favourite because of the opportunity to dress up, play games with friends and get free sweets and candies. It is considered a kids festival but the original halloween involved the whole community. The Irish Origin of Halloween: Samhain 
Halloween, which directly stems from Irish, Scottish and British folk customs, was celebrated as the Druids’ autumn festival.. The Druids, who were an order of priests during the third century BC, celebrated this holiday on Oct. 31 (which they recognized as the end of summer), to honor Samhain, the lord of death. 
Witchcraft, Satanism, paganism and virtually all facets of the occult acquire instruction from the Druids. From the popular jack-o’-lantern, trick-or-treat, costumes, to the pranks, ghoulish ghosts, demons, goblins and witches – Halloween owes its morbid birth to the Druids. Halloween—the day itself is of Druidic origin. </p>

        <h2><strong>why don t christians celebrate halloween halloween slik</strong></h2>
        <p>Setting aside a day to celebrate evil, darkness, witchcraft, fear, death and the demonic brings disdain to God. Period. A Christian celebrating Halloween would be like a Satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at Christmas while singing, "Happy Birthday, Jesus!" The two just don't go together. 
Many Christians believe that participating in Halloween is a form of involvement in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness, which is forbidden in Scripture: Ephesians 5:7–15. Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. 
The word Halloween literally means the evening before All Hallows Day (or All Saint’s Day) celebrated on November 1. Halloween is also the shortened name of Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Evening and All Saint’s Eve which is celebrated on October 31. The origin and meaning of Halloween are derived from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, but  
Stories. Should Christians Celebrate Halloween? It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with whether to celebrate Halloween. Some see it as a dark day full of evil influence while others deem it a harmless time for fun costumes and candy. This answer from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association may offer some guidance on Halloween and even  
Your Reason for Celebrating Halloween (or Not) Matters. Your motive for why you want to celebrate matters. If the intention is to embrace evil or seek attention through a “sexy” costume, then it's not aligned with what God is cheering on. As "Christ Followers,” Christians are called to exemplify love, compassion, respect for others, and  
Reasons Why Christians Don’t Celebrate Halloween Swirling around Halloween’s fall festivities and trick-or-treating are the not-so-subtle connections to problematic supernatural practices. Despite the distance from its period of origin, Halloween still remains connected to paganism. 
Televangelist Pat Robertson still warns that Halloween is a day when millions of children “celebrate Satan.”. “There’s a longstanding discourse in America about ‘innocents at risk  
Yes, Christians can, because the blood of Christ has redeemed Halloween. Traditionally, October 31, which is named Halloween or All Hallows’ Eve, has been considered a pagan holiday. On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a  
Christians should take time to inform the consciences of friends and family with biblical truth regarding God, the Bible, sin, Christ, future judgment, and the hope of eternal life in Jesus Christ for the repentant sinner. There are several different ways Christians will engage in Halloween evangelism. Some will adopt a "No Participation" policy. 
As believers, we are called to take the light into the darkness, not run away from it. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it” (John 1:5, NLT). Halloween is a night that is celebrated all over the world as a night that glorifies evil and desensitizes children to things that the enemy loves. 
A Light in the Darkness. When your kids ask why your family doesn’t celebrate Halloween, don’t focus too heavily on the darkness, like its pagan roots and the fact that witchcraft plays  
With the origins and the practices of Halloween in mind, here are three reasons why we believe you should consider ditching Halloween from your (and your children’s) lives: 1. God forbids the merging of pagan customs into our lives. 
But he knows some people would argue that even other important dates for Christians also have an evil origin, like Christmas and Easter. However, he focused on what it promotes. “But in reality, why we don’t celebrate Halloween is because not of just the origins but because of what it promotes,” he said. 
1. Should Christians renounce Halloween as “the Devil’s day”? One of the most famous recent examples of Christian interaction with Halloween comes from Pat Robertson, who called Halloween the “festival of the Devil.” As such, he claimed that participating in Halloween is wrong for Christians. 
Due to its decidedly pagan origins, the answer to the question as to whether Christians should celebrate Halloween is a resounding no. The answer to the question as to whether can Christians participate in Halloween activities without compromising their faith is more difficult. 
Others don’t do anything special at all. So why don’t some Christians observe Halloween? Some Christians don’t celebrate Halloween because of its pagan roots and its present-day associations with evil. Most Christians understand that children and families who dress in costumes and go trick-or-treating don’t have ungodly intentions. 
Should, as Christians, we be weary about how we choose to engage in the Holiday? Yes. Like so many other things, we need to consult Romans 14 and align how we choose (or don't) to celebrate Halloween. There's a slippery slope between legalism and Christian freedom; what is suitable for one person isn't necessarily right for another. 
Many churches around the country have harvest festivals or other events to provide a safe place for families to celebrate. Communities need to know that Christians are not isolationists. They can welcome trick-or-treaters with ‘Snickers’ and a smile. Halloween, however, should not be celebrated in ignorance. 
On October 31st each year people across the United States celebrate Halloween or All Hallow's Eve. Widely geared toward young children who enjoy wearing costumes, trick-or-treating, and pumpkin carving, Halloween has become the second-largest commercially celebrated holiday in America grossing over $8 billion in sales. What is the Origin &amp; History of Halloween? Halloween's origin can 
Why don’t Christians celebrate Halloween? The first major holiday of the school year: Halloween. From the day that he asked about the pumpkins, we have been giving him bits of information about Halloween any time he had questions. But it’s not just a choice for our family not to celebrate it. Our beliefs are rooted in the Bible. And while  </p>

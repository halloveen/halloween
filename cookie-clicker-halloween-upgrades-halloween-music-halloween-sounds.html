Halloween season is a seasonal event in Cookie Clicker. It begins on the 24th of October and ends on the 31st. Alternatively, it can also be activated at any time by purchasing the "Ghostly biscuit" switch, which is obtained by unlocking the season switcher, a heavenly upgrade that costs 1,111 heavenly chips. 
Start in Valentine's day for all of the upgrades. Switch to Christmas to collect every Festive Hat upgrade. When a Cookie Storm starts, switch to Easter and click storm drops until all of the storm drops are gone [4]. Return to Christmas. When the Wrinkler cap is reached, switch to Halloween and pop all wrinklers [5]. 
Seasons are events that unlock special upgrades and achievements, and alter gameplay. They can be helpful to get achievements that can only be earned in the first run or through Challenge Mode, such as True Neverclick or Speed baking III. The first season introduced was Halloween Season in October 2013, followed by Christmas Season in December 2013, Valentine's Day Season in February 2014  
Seasons are events in Cookie Clicker that are based on holidays and give upgrades (usually as random drops), have unique achievements, and have special effects while staying in those seasons. Seasons will be triggered at certain times based on the system's clock, or forced through the season switcher. The quickest way to get all seasonal  
The Halloween season in Cookie Clicker unlocks special upgrades, achievements, and alters gameplay. It was introduced in October 2013 and can be triggered automatically for a defined period of time around the Halloween holiday.

To obtain Halloween cookies in Cookie Clicker, follow these steps: 1. Unlock Halloween cookies by meeting specific requirements, typically reaching a specific level or milestone in the game. 2. Click on the Halloween-themed golden cookies that randomly appear on the screen to obtain Halloween cookies. 
Halloween Season: Oct. 24th - Oct. 31st. Christmas Season: Dec. 15th - Dec. 31st. Another way for players to access these seasonal events outside of their scheduled appearance is through the prestige mechanic in Cookie Clicker. After the player has baked 1 trillion cookies, they may use the Legacy button to reset their progress and ascend. 
The ascension screen is accessed by the Legacy button, which is under the Info button. Although you can ascend as early as you want, it will not give any benefit until you have baked enough cookies. Depending on how many cookies you have baked, you will earn Heavenly Chips and Prestige Levels when ascending (at a 1:1 ratio). Heavenly Chips are used in the Ascension screen to purchase Heavenly  
I dont want to get the grandmapocalypse steps cuz in my late game stage its pretty useless, but I think I need wrinklers and wrath cookies to get the halloween cookie upgrades. Is this true? Currently I’m not getting upgrades from normal golden cookies at all, so I’m wondering if one mind is required for halloween. 
Upgrades are purchasable items in Cookie Clicker that make buildings and some other parts of the game better. As of version 2.052, there are 716 normal upgrades, and 13 debug upgrades. 
For upgrades in beta versions of Cookie Clicker (if any), see Cookie Clicker Beta. For Heavenly Upgrades, see Ascension#Upgrade Tree. Upgrades are things that make buildings and some other parts of the game better. As of version 2.052, there are 716 normal upgrades, and as of version 2.045, 13 debug upgrades.

News : what do golden cookies taste like? Study reveals a flavor "somewhere between spearmint and liquorice". Golden Cookies are recurring objects that show up on the screen in a random position during normal gameplay.

The first iteration of this upgrade costs 666,666 cookies and increases the effectiveness of clicking, and boosts the CpS of grandmas based on the number of portals owned. The boost in CpS from purchasing the Elder Pledge can be a huge gift in the beginning of the end game of Cookie Clicker.

This will not result in slower progress, as long as the upgrades from two or more consecutive ascensions, or at least the most important upgrades, are  
The Grandmapocalypse is an in-game event that affects both the 1.0 Update of the game, as well as the pre-update version. It affects the background as well as the appearance of the game window and causes spawning of Wrinklers and Wrath cookies. Once "One Mind" is purchased, the Grandmapocalypse begins. The Grandmas are now considered "Awoken" and the Grandmatriarch Status will change to Awoken  
Wrinklers are twitchy leech-like creatures that, in normal gameplay, only start to appear during the Grandmapocalypse. While they at first appear to reduce CpS (cookies per second), they actually provide a massive boost to cookie production in the long run. There is a 0.01% chance a Shiny Wrinkler will spawn instead of a normal wrinkler. There is a 0.01% chance upon starting the game that all

The unlock rate is 5% base and up to 91% depending on achievements, upgrades, dragon auras, heavenly upgrades, pantheon gods, garden plants, and wrinkler type (normal or shiny).

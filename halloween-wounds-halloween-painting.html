        <p>Dab the area where you want the fake wound with glue. 6. Arrange the bits of tissue on top of the glue. 7. Mold and shape the sticky tissue so it looks like the shape of a wound or scar. 8. Sprinkle cocoa powder around the edges to darken the wound. 9. Top off with fake blood. 
Let the Vaseline dry for about 5 to 10 minutes. Then, use an eyeshadow or makeup brush to apply color to the inside and surrounding areas of the fake wound. Use dabbing rather than swiping motions to keep the Vaseline intact. Use a darker shade of brown or gray in the center of the cut to add depth.

Curl or pull back the edges around the slit, to form a raise layer of fake scar tissue. For a long cut, keep the tear long but narrow. For a more shocking wound, tear it into a wide, mangled mess. 5.

In this OneHowTo video we show you step by step how to make a fake wound from scratch using household materials. Create a realistic and convincing fake wound 
Using a disposable sponge, start applying the liquid latex on your skin. Drag it to the length you want your wound, plus an extra inch on all sides. Before the first layer dries, tear off a piece of toilet paper about the length and width of the liquid latex smear and apply it on top. You can tear off any excess edges. 
Step 1: The Video. This is the video of the making process, and the prank itself. Short Background: The April Fool's Day this year, was during the Coronavirus lockdown. As you can imagine, during a lockdown you're bored, depressed and having some fun is always good, so I decided to make a simple prank on my wife. 
For the colour of the wound I used nail polish to give a shine to the wound-similar to the effect dried blood can have. I have also l ayered up the nail polish in the centre of the wound, where the cut is as well as adding a darker shade of nail polish to the very middle of the cut. Step 4: Add Extras Eg. Stitching or Pus.

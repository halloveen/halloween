Of this run of redos, Zack Synder's Dawn Of The Dead is arguably the best. However, Rob Zombie's Halloween might rank as the most divisive. The idea of remaking John Carpenter's Halloween - a movie that essentially gave birth to the slasher movie as it currently exists - was already considered sacrilege.

Rob Zombie’s Halloween (2007) remains one of the most widely, and viciously, despised remakes of all time – despite how The Thing (2011) threw out its finely-tuned practical effects in favor of shoddy CGI, and Child’s Play (2019) made Chucky a sad sack loser whose whimpers echoed from the closet in which he was far too easily trapped by loser-pants Andy. 
From the visionary mind of Rob Zombie comes the horrific story of five carnival workers who are kidnapped the night before Halloween and held hostage in a large compound. At the mercy of their captors, they are forced to play a twisted game of life or death called 31.

The series is a reboot of the 1978 horror film of the same name. Rob Zombie's "reimagining" follows the premise of John Carpenter's original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people. 
For his follow-up film, Zombie again took certain key ingredients left over from the original Halloween sequel –– the immediate aftermath of the first film, Michael Myers rampaging through a hospital, and so on –– and morphed them into something new, something with a flavor that might remind you of future sequels like Halloween 4. </p>

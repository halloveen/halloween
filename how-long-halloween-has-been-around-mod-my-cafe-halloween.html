Countries around the world celebrate Halloween. While the U.S. may have popularized the modern-day traditions of pumpkin carving and trick-or-treating, these practices have been gradually  
Trick-or-treating—setting off on Halloween night in costume and ringing doorbells to demand treats—has been a tradition in the United States and other countries for more than a century. Its  
Halloween, one of the world’s oldest holidays, is celebrated in countries around the world. The United States, England and Mexico all celebrate versions of Halloween with unique traditions and

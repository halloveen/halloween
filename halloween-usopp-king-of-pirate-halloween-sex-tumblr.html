A quick sketch of Usop's fantastic new outfit! I'm so happy the glow up ussop got. Out of all the characters he is what represents us the most. Cause I know damn well I'll be shitting myself.if I had to face kaido. You know damn well Bartolomeo represents us the most if we lived in the same world. 
Usopp contrasts Kuro, the main villain of his introductiory arc. Usopp is a Lovable Coward who wants to be a pirate, while Kuro is a Dirty Coward who wants to retire from piracy. Usopp tells lies to Kaya to make her feel better, only to find that she doesn't believe him when he accuses Klahadaore (aka Kuro) of being a pirate, while Kuro uses

Usopp, a central figure in the globally acclaimed manga and anime series „One Piece,“ is a character that embodies growth, courage, and dreams. As the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, his journey is a testament to perseverance, friendship, and the relentless pursuit of one’s aspirations. This article offers an in-depth exploration into

I have a feeling that Usopp will somehow end up being the king of the pirates with all the character development he has went through. Luffy is still the same character and doesn't seem to have the right qualities for a king of the pirates. This reminds me of the the Game of Thrones ending when Bran Stark became king of the pirates. Thoughts? 
The Usopp Pirates was a group of children who pretended to be pirates in Syrup Village. It was formerly led by Usopp until he chose to join the Straw Hat Pirates.[1] The group's Jolly Roger was like any other in the world of One Piece, except that instead of a proper jaw with teeth, the skull has an open mouth that is elongated vertically.

Luffy's adventure in becoming Pirate King is filled with grim and messed up stuff, but Usopp is there to find the fun on the adventure with him. Luffy gained his dream while Usopp lost his mother. Luffy is honest while Usopp is a liar. Luffy is the true God while Usopp is the false God. Similar but completely opposite. Like a man and his shadow. 
"God" Usopp[10] is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[2] He is the fourth member of the crew and the third to join, doing so at the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[17] Usopp is the son of Yasopp and the late Banchina. He was born and  
Usopp also has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal

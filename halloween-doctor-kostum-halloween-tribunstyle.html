        <p>"Death has come to your little town, sheriff." ―Samuel Loomis to Leigh Brackett Dr. Samuel Loomis is a character and one of the protagonists of the Halloween franchise. He first appeared in the original Halloween (1978). Loomis' history is complicated by the fact that the series follows several conflicting continuities. Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later and Resurrection ignore the events of  
Dr. Samuel J. Loomis is a fictional character in the Halloween franchise. A main protagonist of the overall series, Loomis appears on-screen in eight of the thirteen Halloween films (and is mentioned or featured in photographs and audio recordings in others), first appearing in John Carpenter 's original 1978 film. 
Dr. Loomis returned in Halloween II, which picks up moments after the end of the first movie.While Laurie was taken to the hospital, Loomis and Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) continued the search for Michael, and Loomis found evidence that connected Michael to the occult practice of Samhain, which could offer an explanation to his murder sprees and invulnerability. 
Halloween tells the story of Michael Myers, who on Halloween night 1963, murdered his older sister when he was just six years old. Michael was then sent to Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, where he stayed for over a decade and became Dr. Sam Loomis’ (Donald Pleasence) patient. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael escaped and returned  
Michael's psychiatrist. On November 5, 1963, then six-year-old Michael Myers had been admitted to Smith's Grove Sanitarium for the October 31st murder of his older sister, Judith. The child (now seven) was a blank, emotionless slate to Loomis, never speaking and barely even moving. 
Dr. Samuel James Loomis is a fictional character in the Halloween film series. He is the main protagonist and hero of the 1978 classic Halloween and its many sequels (except from III, H20 and Resurrection). Donald Pleasence plays the character of Dr. Loomis in all five films. Throughout the Halloween franchise, he has become somewhat of a

A Day in the Limelight: Halloween: Sam, taking place in the H20 timeline, expands on the doctor's past in a way the films never did. Aborted Arc: The Producer's Cut of Curse ends with Wynn touching Loomis and passing the Thorn symbol onto him, seemingly indicating that the latter must now act as the cult's leader.

Halloween Kills made the bold choice of featuring Loomis as part of the sequel's extended 1978 flashback sequence, but instead of mapping Pleasence's face on a stand-in, the role is played by Tom Jones, Jr. If the name Tom Jones, Jr doesn't sound familiar, that's because Halloween Kills' Dr. Loomis is his first acting credit.

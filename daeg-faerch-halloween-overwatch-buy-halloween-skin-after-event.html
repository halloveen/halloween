        <p>Daeg Neergaard Faerch (/ ˈ d eɪ ɡ ˈ f ɛər k /; [1] born September 27, 1995), [2] [3] also known as GreatDaeg or Dnmrkboom is an American actor, singer, songwriter, and rapper. He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of young Michael Myers in Rob Zombie 's horror remake Halloween (2007). 
Halloween: Directed by Rob Zombie. With Malcolm McDowell, Brad Dourif, Tyler Mane, Daeg Faerch. After being committed for 15 years, Michael Myers, now a grown man and still very dangerous, escapes from the mental institution and immediately returns to Haddonfield to find his baby sister, Laurie. 
Whether fans approved or disapproved of this plot direction, the actor who played young Michael, Daeg Faerch, was highly praised for his work with the role. Unfortunately, Faerch did not return for Rob Zombie’s Halloween 2, leaving many fans confused. The young actor had primarily been involved in theatrical acting prior to his film debut in  
We were lucky enough to catch up with Daeg as his latest film, Josie, is set to arrive in theaters and VOD on March 16 th. The film is directed by Eric England (Contracted, Get the Girl), and he  
Carpenter's original Halloween didn't offer viewers a direct reason for why Michael is so murderous, though the 1995 sequel took an unfortunate stab at it.

Daeg Faerch portrayed the role of young Michael Myers in Rob Zombie's Halloween remake of 2007. Faerch was cast in the Halloween remake as a young Michael Myers, performing his own stunts. Faerch's performance as the murderous young Myers was met with positive reviews. KPBS said of the young actor: "Daeg Faerch is key in making these early scenes work. He delivers a truly chilling performance

Daeg Neergaard Faerch (born September 27, 1995), also known as GreatDaeg, is an American actor. He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of young Michael Myers in Rob Zombie's horror remake Halloween (2007). Faerch has also played in theatrical productions of Grapes of Wrath in which he played the role of Winfield, Marat/Sade in which he played the role of young Herald, Waiting for Godot  
Rob Zombie said he casted Daeg because he looked "different" from other kids which I feel was a step in the wrong direction. The Michael Myers in the original film looked like a young, angelic &amp; innocent kid, which was partly why the murders were so shocking. 
Following his fateful Halloween night murder rampage in the quiet town of Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael Myers begins 17 years of incarceration at the Smith's Grove Sanitarium maximum-security mental facility where he is treated by noted child behaviorist Dr. Samuel Loomis--the only person who can truly understand Michael's evil nature. 
In Rob Zombie's "Halloween," Satan is borne into the body of 10-year-old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch), a young man living a trailer trash existence in seemingly idyllic Haddonfield.

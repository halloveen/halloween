        <p>Wheelbarrow Skeleton. This is one of the more unique graveyard Halloween yard ideas on the list. This graveyard Halloween yard idea is tailored around the idea of using a wheelbarrow that is going to have a skeleton in it. We adore this aesthetic. It’s unique and it is going to stand out because of the wheelbarrow. 
How to make DIY Halloween yard ghosts. Fortunately, ghosts are pretty easy to make. Here’s what you need: white creepy cloth *. styrofoam ball *. black marker. hook. Draw eyes and a round mouth on the styrofoam with a black marker. Drape the creepy cloth over the styrofoam. 
Now on to the inspiration! We found some amazing families DIY’ing Halloween props and scenes that will blow your Jack O’Lantern display from last year out of the water. We looked for super cool, completely haunted scenes as well as some simpler, easier projects. So there’s something for every level of DIY. Bring it on, Halloween lovers! 
Place Halloween tombstones (mixed up randomly, as you’d see in an old cemetery, so it looks like the real thing) on the ground. Secure the tombstones to the ground, some upright and some at angles. I would also place 2-3 of them on the ground like they’d fallen over. 
Step 1 – Trace the tombstones. Even if you want to build a 100% DIY graveyard, it helps to have some store-bought stones to use as templates. Unless, or course, you’re an artist, in which case, you can freehand them! I started by tracing several different shapes and sizes onto 1-inch foam insulation for my DIY cemetery. 
Creating a DIY outdoor Halloween cemetery is a fun and rewarding project that can transform your yard into a haven of horror. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you’ll be well on your way to crafting a display that’s sure to impress and terrify your neighbors and passersby. It’s not just about creating a spooky scene; it’s  
Depending on how in-depth you want to go with your spooky Halloween graveyard, adding in props like fake spider webs or a fog machine can take it up a notch. Most fog machines can set you back around $60 and you can find them at any party supply store. Alternatively, you can create your own fog chiller for under $20. 
The Graveyard – During The Day . I’ll show you it during the day first, so you can really see the details (then at night where it really comes alive – SEE WHAT I DID THERE). Okay, so the fence – I did a lot of pinning on graveyards and my favorites had a perimeter fence (mostly iron and ornate). 
This Halloween graveyard is a must for your DIY outdoor Halloween decorations! Create a spooky, cheap, and easy Halloween fence and be the talk of the town! The kids absolutely love all of the fun, scary DIY outdoor Halloween decorations that we come across in our neighborhood, even if they act like they are scared at first! Haha! 
The first step is to make four squares out of the short 2″ x 2″ boards. These will be the top and bottom of the frames. To do this, lay the pieces of wood out in a square. Continue all the way around until you’ve attached all of the boards together. Then repeat the same process until you have 4 squares.

This year’s theme was a Halloween graveyard equipped with a cemetery entrance, fake tombstones and the props that completed the graveyard. And even though this looks like a lot it was actually inexpensive because I used mostly items from around my house and only had to purchase a few supplies. 
Halloween graveyard fencing and gravestones are so easy to build, you don’t need to spend a lot of money at the local Halloween stores. Make them yourself in a little bit of time, with a few simple supplies. Set the mood for a great Halloween, whether you are having a party or not! Add some fake spider webs in the fence to make it even scarier!

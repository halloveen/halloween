I'm bugged here so long time and waste bms time, I hope after fixed I will get back some time for bms 
Pokemon Revolution is an online free to play Pokemon MMO. Massive world of Pokemon with many regions, both original and custom, never seen in any other game. 
Hi, i can't do the Halloween quest. When you go to the event island , there is a quest where you have to collect 10 candy. Me , when I go to the event island there is no quest like that. I can directly go to the next map. So there is no npc and I can't do the Darkrai quest. Quote 
Sweetsland is one of the five cities that are part of the Halloween event. Though it does not have much to offer, it is necessary to go through to reach Unison Mountain Summit, which can be confusing since it is not a map that is directly connected to the rest of Unison Mountain. 
Thank you for the quick update. We are glad that you are no longer stuck and that you can progress with the Halloween quest. Good luck! If you wish to report a different bug, please feel free to create a new thread in the Bug Resolution Center. Thank you and have a good day. Regards, Unowned 
The Halloween candies are hidden in all Murky town, 4 in the houses, 3 are hidden in the surroundings and 3 in the Pokemon center. Can you provide evidence with images talking with the ten NPCs? :) Oh, and can you tell me what server are you from? please

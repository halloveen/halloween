"Masked Gentleman" is a Limited A-Tier Costume for the Magician, Servais Le-Roy. It was introduced for a limited time to the Illusion Hall during the 2018 Halloween Event.

This survivor costume mimics the appearance of Jack the Ripper in his original skin, with a green trenchcoat, white mask  
Trick or treat! The Halloween event is starting again this year! If you participate in the event, you will receive a mechanical engineer's SSR costumes can be obtained! Other Halloween themed costumes, Furniture is also available! Some past Halloween costumes and items are also reprinted! 
The following refers to the Event Storylines from 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023. 2018 and 2020 had unrelated Halloween storylines. It is theorised that Cosmic Witch is the one "great witch" mentioned in the 2022 Twilight Banquet event that could "turn back turn back time and change one's fate" and who was transmuted into the watch[1] used in the event to turn back time, as in her essence trailer

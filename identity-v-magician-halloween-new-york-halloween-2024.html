        <p>The Halloween Event is one of the main game events available in Identity V. Typically, at least one limited A-Tier costume will be awarded to players for free each year, making this event one of the most anticipated events in the game.

"Masked Gentleman" is a Limited A-Tier Costume for the Magician, Servais Le-Roy. It was introduced for a limited time to the Illusion Hall during the 2018 Halloween Event. His appearance cannot be easily seen, however, it is unchanged from his default physical appearance. This survivor costume mimics the appearance of Jack the Ripper in his original skin, with a green trenchcoat, white mask  
Trick or treat! The Halloween event is starting again this year! If you participate in the event, you will receive a mechanical engineer's SSR costumes can be obtained! Other Halloween themed costumes, Furniture is also available! Some past Halloween costumes and items are also reprinted! 
The following refers to the Event Storylines from 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023. 2018 and 2020 had unrelated Halloween storylines. It is theorised that Cosmic Witch is the one "great witch" mentioned in the 2022 Twilight Banquet event that could "turn back turn back time and change one's fate" and who was transmuted into the watch[1] used in the event to turn back time, as in her essence trailer

"Aladdin" is a Limited A-Tier Costume for the Hell Ember, Leo Beck.

When equipped, Leo's body is covered in bandages and appears injured, with many bruises and wounds visible on his arms and torso  
Jack, also known as The Ripper, is a Difficulty Level 1 Hunter available for purchase after the completion of the prologue. He is one of 30 playable Hunters added to Identity V.

Also, unpopular opinion but I actually like rescuing magician (and being rescued as magician) because he has the ability of being invisible for a short time right after getting rescued. 90% of the time I get rescued as magician, the hunter loses me and I get a chance to get healed by a team mate or search a chest for an item to help me later

The band's current lineup includes constant members Weikath  
Halloween's breakout album Tricks, Treats and Other Tales from the Crypt was recorded in 2002 with what has come to be known as the Halloween 4.0 lineup.

Their early records were fast and brittle, a distinctly European take on American thrash. Hansen was the vocalist on the band’s self-titled debut EP and their first album, Walls Of Jericho, before deciding that playing guitar and singing was more trouble than it was worth. “I never considered myself a singer,” he says. “I was a shouter.

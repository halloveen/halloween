        <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2024 will occur on Thursday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people  
The name "Halloween," of course, is a contraction of "All Hallow's Eve." That's the eve of All Saints Day, or All Hallows Day, as it was popularly known in Britain.

Halloween had its origins in the festival of Samhain among the Celts of ancient Britain and Ireland.

All Saints Day is an annual Christian feast day in which, as the title implies, all saints are celebrated, both known and unknown. It was originally celebrated closer  
When is Halloween, and what is the true story behind it? Every year it's held on October 31 for two reasons: a pagan one and a Christian one. The ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, which occurred on November 1 but kicked off the evening before, is considered the earliest known root of our secular Halloween traditions. 
Now, in my own home, we do participate in Halloween festivities. For us, Halloween is not a celebration of fear or death — God kicked those to the curb through Jesus. We celebrate family being silly together. We celebrate the community around us. We celebrate dress-up. We celebrate sweetness. We celebrate life in all its abundance! 
Why do we celebrate Halloween? The origins of Halloween go back thousands of years to Celtic Ireland, evolving through Christianity and Irish immigration to America. It has kept many of its original themes and traditions, including acknowledging spirits, wearing disguises, and exchanging treats.

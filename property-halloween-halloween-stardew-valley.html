        <p>But before you get wrapped up in the thrill of costumes and candy, take a moment to ensure that your home is 1. safe for those ridiculously cute trick-or-treaters while simultaneously 2. discouraging criminal activity from thieves and mischief-makers.

These ten Halloween house prep ideas will help you set the tone and prepare your property. 1. Create Your Spooky Atmosphere.

What do you think people will be  
You can use copy like, “Don’t get spooked,” “No need to be scared,” “Let’s find your boo-tiful home,” “Don’t let dead lines creep up on you,” and so many more. You can probably come up with your own real estate Halloween marketing copy if you give it some thought. 7. Fall Fire Pit Homebuyer Event.

SM’s Halloween Party 2014. Next, we have another Halloween party in 2014! In this year, seems the party is brighter than the previous one in 2013, since there’s a lot of magnificent costumes at the Halloween Party 2014! Are you curious about that? Let’s take a look at SM’s Halloween Party in 2014! onehallyu.com 
Damn half of the attendees are NCT and it isn't even the full group lol. Ngl kinda sad to see so few seniors here. Shindong is a shoo-in here, but Siwon is a big surprise since he doesn't dress up that often + I expected folks like Leeteuk, Heechul and Yesung to at least pop in. Onew has gone viral before in the Halloween party so he was expected too but I'm sad Key and Minho couldn't go. 
SM Entertainment artists amuse us with their incredible costumes at the annual 'SMTOWN HALLOWEEN PARTY'. And this is SNSD Yoona,Taeyeon,Sunny &amp; Hyoyeon costu </p>

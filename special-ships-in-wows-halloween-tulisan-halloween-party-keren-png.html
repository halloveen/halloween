Let the battleships and cruisers hold down the middle and give you support when needed. Float back and forth in those areas I circled in the picture unloading torps all the time, dont shoot unless you have too. Also keeping distance above 4.8km from other ships.

for me, the main difference between Premium Ships and the Tier 10 Special Ships is where the Credit Bonus is located. In all Premium Ships it is 'baked into' the Ship's hull In Special Ships it is part of the Permanent Camouflage Which means you can put a promotional camo that has a Credit bonus onto a Premium ship and get extra credits. 
Alternatively: Deal 900,000 damage to enemy ships in Halloween mode. (75 Renown) Shakedown Trial 1 (Locked by Week 2's Endurance Trial 4) Hit enemy ships 600 times with your main battery guns in Standard, Arcade, or Versus AI Battles. Tier IV – Legendary Tier. Alternatively: Destroy 45 enemy ships in Halloween mode. 
Tier X special ships - ready vessels that can be purchased in-game for doubloons or Free XP, in the Armory or via select bundles within the Premium Shop. Benefits of Tier X special ships: No research required — all modules unlocked and mounted — in most cases. A permanent economic bonus package. Reduced post-battle service cost. 
The Halloween mode is a special event that allows developers to try out and test new game mechanics and features that could be used in the future. After the operation’s completion, the World of Warships team will evaluate community feedback and consider introducing submarines as the fifth ship class in the game. 
Once an enemy ship is in range start spamming your torpedoes and you should be able to kill them with ease. General tips: Always try to have at least 2 ships or more in the circle so the Transylvania keeps moving. The ship is a healer, so if you need to repair just get in the circle.

1 Permanent camouflage, Premium ship, or Commander from the following list: Unsinkable Sam permanent camouflage for Cossack, Ark Royal or Bismarck; Historical permanent camouflage for Cossack, Ark Royal or Bismarck; VIII Cossack, VI Ark Royal or VIII Bismarck; 10-skill-point special Commander Unsinkable Sam for German ships or British ships 
A quick look at the premium ships in WoWs and you can see the B ships. From that list I’d like: JB B Alaska B Cossack B Tirpitz B But that’s just me and what I would like. But they always seem to bring one B ship exclusive to Legends and it’s usually a T5 so I can’t begin to think which T5 I’d like as a B ship maybe T-61 B? </p>

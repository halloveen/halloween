        <p>See my other instructable "Monster-In-A-Box (Part 2, The Guts) for the second part of this build. Tools used: Tape measure, t-square, Miter Saw, finishing nailer, drill, drill bits, circular saw or jigsaw, reciprocating saw, pry bar, hammer, wood clamps, chemical respirator, goggles, gloves. 
The prop has 2 operational states "Sleeping" and "Awake". While sleeping the box is relatively calm and only makes snoring and light growling sounds. The monster is awoken when a trick-or-treater trips a motion sensor. When the monster is awoken the monster roars, breaths smoke, bounces the lid, and the inside of the box glows red. 
Then cut a piece of 46" x 28" x 1/2" plywood and attach to the bottom of the box. Finally, use two heavy duty hinges and attach the lid the to rest of the box. The list below summarizes all the wood materials required for the box: (15) Top Choice Pine 1 x 6 x 46" Length. (10) Top Choice Pine 1 x 6 x 25" Length.

This is Monster in a Box. This prop is something you see in a lot of professional Haunted House and makes a great scare. Why? It has all the essential elements.

Featuring a fun monster design with other Halloween characters, this treasure chest-shaped treat box is a must-have addition to Halloween party supplies. Fill it with candy, homemade goodies or party favors then place on a table for easy grabbing or buy multiple and hand one out to each party guest. 
But with Halloween so close, I wondered "why not create a Halloween themed Box Monster?" Since I couldn't think of any reason why I shouldn't, here I am with the ever hungry Halloween Box Monster. This goal of this project is the have the Box Monster with it's glowing green eyes wait for people to get close enough before opening its mouth and  
Here are a few key takeaways in case you decide to build your own version of the Monster in a Box: Don’t overcomplicate the design. My idea of wanting to lift both the box and the lid using the same motor and dual cams ended up costing quite a bit of wasted time and effort since the box lifting mechanism was eventually disabled. 
These Halloween monster treat boxes are so cute and fun for the holiday! I prefer cute Halloween to scary Halloween so these are perfect for us. I hope you have fun crafting them if you give this project a try. Below is the tutorial and you’ll find a link to my Resource Library so you can grab a copy of the box files. Supplies Needed

The idea of the zombie, an undead, reanimated corpse, comes from Haiti, where a witch or sorcerer could supposedly bring back to life a dead person. The idea was popular among Haitian slaves, who believed that if they were good, they would go to a heavenly afterlife, but if they were bad, they would become a zombie and a slave forever. 
Arduino based controller for a Monster In A Box Halloween prop. The idea is pretty simple: create the illusion that some type of container is holding a dangerous monster that is on the verge of escaping. 
See my other instructable "Monster-In-A-Box Halloween Prop (Part 1, The Box) or just a good pallet box" for instructions on building the box. In this part I'll go into detail on how I went about applying pneumatics, a prop controller, a fog machine, lights and sound to create and choreograph the movements of the prop. 
The box is powered by 120 volt AC and stepped down to 12 volt DC. The box works as follows: 1. A person walks in front of the box and sets off the motion detector. The sensor is on the outside of the box mounted in a receptacle box. 2. The motion sensor will stay on and continue to complete the circuit until it no longer sees movement. 3.

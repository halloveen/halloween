I followed your tutorial for my 2 year old grandson's Halloween costume last October and it was absolutely adorable! He looked at himself in the mirror and excitedly said, "SHEEP, SHEEP!" Shaun the Sheep is his favorite show - and he had a Shaun the Sheep birthday party in August. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful design!

A DIY sheep costume is an easy and fun way to dress up for Halloween or any costume party. Whether you want to go as a cute and cuddly lamb or as the mischievous Shaun the Sheep, making your own costume allows you to customize it to your liking and save money in the process. 
Simon was given the part of a sheep in the Christmas play this year. His costume was my favorite to make! What you need: black shirt or sweatshirt black sweatpants black hoodie cap black socks 1 sheet of black craft felt 1 sheet of pink craft felt fabric glue bag of polyfill What to do: Cover the front of the shirt (from neck to hem, no arms) with fabric glue, the more the better. 
Shaun finds the wig and can't resist trying it on. Bitzer loses the wig while admonishing Shaun. The race is on as Shaun and Bitzer try to return the wig in time for the farmer's big night. [7] Note: This episode shares its premise with a Nintendo DS video game titled Shaun the Sheep: Off His Head, which had been released two months earlier.

Dec 27, 2023 - Welcome to the official Shaun the Sheep website! Find out about Aardman's iconic sheep, star of animation films, TV shows, games, commercials and more. 
This set of episodes is quite funny. I really enjoyed them and am glad they are finally available in the U.S. Everyone from our 4-year-old twins up to my 60+ year-old parents just love Shaun the Sheep. We bought all four DVD's of Shaun the Sheep and got a Wallace and Gromit DVD with the 3 classic episodes on it for free! 
The naughty pigs are at it again! Poor Shaun is doing some trick or treating when the pigs strike. But then it is the pigs who end up running! See what happe </p>

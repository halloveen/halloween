The Halloween effect is also studied in Arabic stock markets by Zarour (2007) and in Asian stock markets by Lean (2011). Zarour (2007) finds that the Halloween effect is present in 7 of the 9  
Oct 30, 2012 ·  In what is considered to be a seminal piece of research on the subject, “The Halloween Indicator, ‘Sell in May and Go Away’: Another Puzzle,” authors Sven Bouman and Ben Jacobsen were among the first to document a strong seasonal effect in global stock markets. In 36 of the 37 developed and emerging markets they studied between 1973 and

Feb 1, 2021 ·  To answer the sceptics, we use all historical data (62962 observations) on all stock market indices worldwide to verify the robustness of the so-called Halloween Indicator or Sell in May effect.

This paper examines the existence of the month-of-the-year effects in four different continents, namely Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania. Nine indexes were analyzed in order to verify differences between monthly returns from January 1990 to December 2013, followed by an examination of the January effect, Halloween effect, and the October effect, testing for statistical significance using an

Their research suggests that the Halloween effect represents an exploitable anomaly and has negative implications for claims of stock market efficiency.Re  
Oct 1, 2014 ·  Our simple new test for the Sell in May effect shows it not only defies stock market efficiency but also challenges the existence of a positive risk return trade off. When we examine the effect using all historical data for all stock market indices worldwide, we only find evidence of a significant positive ‘risk return’-trade-off during summer (May-October) in Mauritius. Pooling all  
Oct 15, 2020 ·  Purpose. The subject of this paper is seasonal variation in the return on stocks. The phenomenon we analyze here is known as the “Halloween effect” or the trading strategy “sell in May and go away.”.

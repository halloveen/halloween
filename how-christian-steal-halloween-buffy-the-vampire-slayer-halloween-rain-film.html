        <p>The brief account seeks to vindicate Halloween from its “Satanic” and barbaric origins. While the dark side of Halloween may have been overemphasized, Christians must still acknowledge that the holiday originated (at least) in pagan and mythical practices. The extent to which such practices can be categories as “Satanic” is a debate of  
Televangelist Pat Robertson still warns that Halloween is a day when millions of children “celebrate Satan.”. “There’s a longstanding discourse in America about ‘innocents at risk  
I believe that Christians can still use what the world seeks to corrupt for holy purposes. Christians didn't build on pagan foundations. They excavated pagan traditions, dug out all rot, and then built beautiful new traditions on top of the evil that was once there. All Saints Day, where the origins of Halloween are rooted, is a beautiful holiday. 
Many Christians believe that participating in Halloween is a form of involvement in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness, which is forbidden in Scripture: Ephesians 5:7–15. Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord.

On All Hallows’ Eve, it is said that the souls and spirits of the dead are given the ability to roam the Earth. All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day, was a  
As believers, we are called to take the light into the darkness, not run away from it. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it” (John 1:5, NLT). Halloween is a night that is celebrated all over the world as a night that glorifies evil and desensitizes children to things that the enemy loves. 
Christians should take time to inform the consciences of friends and family with biblical truth regarding God, the Bible, sin, Christ, future judgment, and the hope of eternal life in Jesus Christ for the repentant sinner. There are several different ways Christians will engage in Halloween evangelism. Some will adopt a "No Participation" policy. 
The true origins of Halloween lie with the ancient Celtic tribes who lived in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Brittany. For the Celts, November 1 marked the beginning of a new year and the coming of winter. The night before the new year, they celebrated the festival of Samhain, Lord of the Dead. During this festival, Celts believed the souls of  
Setting aside a day to celebrate evil, darkness, witchcraft, fear, death and the demonic brings disdain to God. Period. A Christian celebrating Halloween would be like a Satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at Christmas while singing, "Happy Birthday, Jesus!" The two just don't go together. 
From a Christian perspective, we can say that this is our rendition of how the “trick or treat” tradition began without its pagan origins. Halloween Background: The Christian Impact.

Others offer safe places for lighthearted fun. Want to share the Gospel with your neighbors? 
Let’s add some faith-filled fun to our Halloween activities. Hosting a “Trunk or Treat” Event. Decorate your car trunk with a biblical theme and join in a community “trunk or treat” event. 
Modern Halloween: Innocent Fun or a Celebration of Evil? Drive around any American neighborhood in the weeks leading up to Halloween, and you’ll see a curious mix of decorations: cheery pumpkins, cartoonish ghosts, and smiling witches sitting alongside gruesome displays of fake blood, severed limbs, and grotesque demonic figures. 
In some circles, Halloween is a night that honors the dead, an excuse to trick or do harm to others, and demons, devils, witches, ghosts, and other dark creatures are celebrated.

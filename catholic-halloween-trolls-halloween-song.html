        <p>Learn how Halloween is a Catholic holy day with roots in the Communion of Saints and the Days of the Dead. Discover the true and original substance of Halloween and how to celebrate it as a Catholic. 
Today, while Halloween often leans toward the secular, its Catholic origins remind us to reflect on the promise of eternal life‚Äîall while enjoying the festivities! It‚Äôs all about how we choose to engage with it. So, let‚Äôs get to the gist: Can Catholics celebrate Halloween? Absolutely, but it‚Äôs important to be thoughtful about what we do. 
As Catholics, the focus should be ‚Äúbringing Christ to the party,‚Äù as Glen so aptly said.Emily emphasized the importance of using Halloween as an opportunity to be a light in your neighborhood. ü§©üí° Meeting neighbors while trick-or-treating? 
Halloween is the eve of the feast of All Saints, when Catholics remember the holy ones in heaven and on earth. Learn how to celebrate Halloween in a Catholic spirit, with the help of Bishop David Konderla and Dr Marcel Brown. 
6. For the Halloween enthusiast ‚Äì Spooky Patrons. Believe it or not, there are a handful of saints that are patrons of all things spooky. Some are patrons of the occult, while St. Columba may have been (per legend) a witch before her conversion. 
The word ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù comes from All Hallow's Eve. All Hallows Eve is the vigil of All Saints Day ‚Äîalso known as All Hallows Day. The word ‚Äúhallow‚Äù means ‚Äúholy.‚Äù (In the Our Father we pray, ‚ÄúHallowed be thy name.‚Äù) All Saints Day is a Holy Day of Obligation, and thus a major feast on the Catholic Church's liturgical calendar. 
Halloween's origins are, in fact, very Christian. Halloween falls on October 31 because of a Pope, and its observances are the result of medieval Catholic piety. 
The Eve of All Hallows, that is to say the feast of All Hallowed (Holy) Souls, or All Saints, Hallowe‚Äôen, is the day before All Hallows, All Saints.As one of the major feasts of the Church‚Äôs year, All Saints is a holy day of obligation, and until the reforms of 1955, it had both a vigil and an octave. 
As a result, the distinctly Catholic nature of Halloween became more and more muted, and it was Catholics pulling back from their own festival that gave rise to the contemporary version of Halloween. The ghoulish version of the festival that we have today is, in many respects, a result of Catholic accommodation to a Protestant culture. 
While we can find a few ‚Äúbaptized‚Äù customs in Halloween, Catholics can proudly say that Halloween is a Catholic holiday. The name ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù comes from the older English, where saints or  
Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain and is now a worldwide event. Learn more about Halloween's origins, traditions, interesting facts, scary movies and more. 
Halloween is a Christian festival because in there he points out that it‚Äôs actually kind of controversial to say what should be really straightforward, namely that Halloween is a Christian feast. 
Halloween is a Catholic Holiday. I hope this post offered some clarification if you were on the fence about whether or not to celebrate Halloween. Remember, Halloween is a Catholic holiday. Don‚Äôt let secular America steal it from us! 
Halloween falls the day before Catholics celebrate All Saints Day, on Nov. 1. Of course, in American culture, Halloween has taken on a life of its own. Although Halloween remains associated with the pagan and occult in the minds of many, that does not necessarily mean that Catholics cannot celebrate Halloween as a cultural event. 
but you‚Äôd never know it when walking down the street in October, seeing houses gaudily strewn with fake spiderwebs, skeletons, and repulsive cadavers. Some Christians have considered withdrawing totally from this ‚Äúholiday,‚Äù since it seems like the domain of the devil. But the proper celebration of Halloween is very much a part of Catholic tradition. [] 
The ‚Äìeen part of Halloween is similarly old-fashioned. ‚ÄúE‚Äôen‚Äù is a contraction of the word even , an older way of saying ‚Äúevening.‚Äù Halloween is thus ‚ÄúAll Hallows‚Äô E‚Äôen‚Äù or ‚Äúthe evening of All Saints‚Äô Day,‚Äù and it came to be celebrated as an early anticipation of the day that followed, the same way people celebrate  </p>

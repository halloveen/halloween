75 Halloween riddles and answers to test your spooky knowledge Scare up some serious fun with these brainteasers for kids and adults. Aug. 28, 2023, 6:50 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 21, 2024, 7:58 PM UTC 
Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and  
Jack Skellington, king of Halloween Town, discovers Christmas Town, but his attempts to bring Christmas to his home causes confusion. Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, is bored with doing the same thing every year for Halloween. One day he stumbles into Christmas Town, and is so taken with the idea of Christmas that he tries  
Carpenter described the look further through the character of Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who says in the first film, “I met this 6-year-old child with this blank, pale emotionless face. 
Michael Myers is an iconic horror villain, one whose face and name are synonymous with the slasher genre. Michael Myers’ name is said many times through the first Halloween film, so it was never a secret who the killer was, but the end credits have him as “The Shape” instead of Michael Myers (except for the six and 23-year-old versions). 
The first time the audience saw Michael Myers unmasked was in John Carpenter’s Halloween.After killing his sister in 1963, Michael Myers stepped out of the house while still wearing his clown mask, and the police removed the mask. 15 years later, back in Haddonfield, Michael got the mask he’s now known for and targeted Laurie Strode and her friends, killing them all and saving Laurie for last. 
Halloween is Auggie's favorite holiday, because it gives him the opportunity to be somebody else for a day. On this particular Halloween, Auggie wants to be Boba Fett, a costume which his mother  
The Halloween Is Grinch Night plot revolves around a peculiar phenomenon in Whoville — a night when the "Sour-Sweet Wind" blows, prompting the Grinch to descend from his mountaintop home to terrorize the Whos with his dog, Max. This special diverges from the traditional redemptive arc seen in the Christmas story. 
Thus, the defeat of evil and of demonic powers is associated with Halloween. For this reason, Martin Luther posted his 95 challenges to the wicked practices of the Church to the bulletin board on the door of the Wittenberg chapel on Halloween. He picked his day with care, and ever since Halloween has also been Reformation Day. 
He was institutionalized and according to his doctor, Sam Loomis, is the personification of evil. On the day before Halloween 15 years later, Myers manages to escape and heads for his home town. On Halloween night, he goes on a rampage while Loomis and the local sheriff search Myers' neighborhood for him. 
If you are a fan of the ’80s movie Halloween 2 or the H2O timeline, Michael’s reasoning for killing his sister and targeting Laurie Strode (who, in the worst franchise move ever, was revealed to be his long-lost sister as well) is due to some obsession with offing his family. But, even in those timelines, Michael is still primarily a  
Auggie sums up his feelings about achieving anonymity behind his mask on Halloween: For me, Halloween is the best holiday in the world. It even beats Christmas. I get to dress up in a costume. I

Corey wakes up and tries to leave the sewers, but Michael Myers grabs him by the neck and almost kills him. The Shape has been living in the tunnels since Halloween Kills, with a homeless person  
Then, Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) tied his origins to a demon-worshipping cult and portrayed him as a sympathetic figure victimized in childhood. Critics weren’t a fan of this  
With a pretty substantial lull following Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, some fans might have thought they’d seen the last of Michael, but in 1995 the Shape was back.The powers that be had seemingly decided that what was missing from the horrifying tale of an evil, increasingly unstoppable killing machine was his backstory and, Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers set out to

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (also known as Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, stylized as Hᚦlloween 6) is a 1995 horror film and the sixth installment in the Halloween series, as well as the final film in the 4-6 Timeline.

These events combine fitness with festive fun and are popular among families and fitness enthusiasts. Comparing Halloween to Traditional Icelandic Festivals 
But despite that most traditional ‘scary ingredients’ being missing, and the fact that this Americanized Halloween is not officially celebrated in Iceland, Icelanders are changing the local traditions and trying to make Halloween their own. It’s just simply too much fun to miss out on. So whether it’s through cartoons, movies or video  
Halloween has arrived, so get your best slutty Joker costume ready. Here’s where to celebrate in Reykjavík.

Near the end of October, you can find Halloween decorations on the houses around Reykjavík, and the local grocery stores stock up on pumpkins whose only purpose is to be carved and left on the porch to rot. 
Unlike Halloween's spookiness, Ash Wednesday is more about the quirky tradition of the "cat in the barrel," a type of Nordic piñata. Interestingly, Halloween began in Iceland as an adult’s celebration with themed parties. But soon, the entire society jumped on the bandwagon, making it an all-age festivity. 
Halloween is a quite recent addition to the holidays and celebrations in Iceland. But a lack of tradition is no excuse to turn down a good party so the people of Reykjavík are celebrating in their own way.

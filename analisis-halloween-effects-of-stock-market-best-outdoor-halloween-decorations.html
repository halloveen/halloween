As Bouman and Jacobsen suggest, the Halloween Effect is the flip side of that old trader’s adage, “Sell in May and go away.”. And it does seem to have some truth to it. Halloween Effect: The  
As noted above, the Halloween strategy aims to capitalize on gains by timing the stock market. It refers to a tactic where investors buy stocks in November and sell them in April. Investors who  
The Halloween Effect, also known as the October Effect, refers to a historical stock market pattern where markets tend to perform better in the period from November to April compared to the period from May to October. This phenomenon is sometimes summarized by the famous adage, "Sell in May and go away, but remember to come back in November". 
The pair showed that in the U.K., for example, over a five-year time horizon, the buy in November and sell in April strategy beat the market 80% of the time. Over 10 years the probability of  
In what is considered to be a seminal piece of research on the subject, “The Halloween Indicator, ‘Sell in May and Go Away’: Another Puzzle,” authors Sven Bouman and Ben Jacobsen were among the first to document a strong seasonal effect in global stock markets. In 36 of the 37 developed and emerging markets they studied between 1973 and  
That’s because Halloween marks the beginning of a seasonally strong period for market returns. This phenomenon, which is called the “Halloween effect,” can be described as a market timing strategy proposing that stocks perform better between October 31 and May 1 than they do between early May and the end of October (hence the “ sell in  
The idea is that savvy investors put their money in stocks during high-return months, then move to safer investments like treasury bonds during low-return months. The Halloween strategy originated in the City of London, where in the late-16 th century the predecessor to the modern stock exchange was born. 
The Halloween strategy is a specific approach to trading based on the Halloween effect. It involves buying S&amp;P500 (SPY) at the open of the first trading day in November and selling the position at the open of the first trading day in May. The goal is to capitalize on the historically better-performing winter months. 
We provide the first empirical explanation for the existence of the Halloween effect, commonly known as "Sell in May and go away." This phenomenon suggests that stocks perform better between November and April than they do between May and October, and is observable in equity markets of 36 countries, from at least 1970 to present (Bouman and Jacobsen, 2002; Zhang &amp; Jacobsen, 2021).

Using the volatility spillover index method based on the quantile vector autoregression (QVAR) model, this paper systematically examines structural changes and corresponding spillover effects within 20 major stock markets under both extreme and normal market conditions, using data spanning from January 2005 to January 2023.

Overall, the time-varying performance of the Halloween effect supports the AMH in the Portuguese stock market. Our study contributes to the literature in seve ral ways.

The results suggest that in the US stock market and other developed markets, the Halloween effect only became detectable in the middle of the 20th century. Recently it is still present in the US stock market and most of the other developed markets, which provides opportunities to build a trading strategy which can beat the market. 
U.S. stock market sectors and industries perform better during winter than summer from 1926 to 2006. In more than two-thirds of sectors and industries, the difference in summer and winter returns, known as the Halloween effect, is statistically significant.

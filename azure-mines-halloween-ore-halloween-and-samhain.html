        <p>Nightmarium is a special ore that spawn between 600m - 1,000m released on October 31st, 2020 (12AM ET) as part of the 2020 Halloween Event. This limited time ore is only available for one day, starting October 31st 12AM EDT (04:00 UTC) and ending November 1st 12AM EDT (04:00 UTC), returning every year on Halloween. The ore is based off of an item called 'Nightmare' from another one of Berezaa  
The azure mines Halloween update is here and sinistytes have returned. Nightmarium should return on the 31st of October as usual. Pumpkinite has not returned 
In this video I discover the 3 new ores and give details about them. 
This article is about a limited time ore. Pumpkinite was an ore introduced in the Halloween Update, and was reintroduced in the 2022 &amp; 2023 Sinister Updates. In a similar way to Frostarium, Pumpkinite's respawn isn't tied to the mine reset, but instead about 1 to 2 chunks of it spawn every hour since a server's creation. The chunks can be found on the cliffside surrounding the Public Mine. To  
Valhalum is an ore found at 5000-5200m that was added in the Valhalum Update on Halloween of 2022. To obtain this ore, you will need the " Completionist " badge and the rank Super Deity to mine it. You also need the Completionist badge to generate it. This ore has a 1/10,000 chance of spawning, equivalent to 0.01%. 
Today I check out the new Halloween Update in Azure Mines, which includes the very exclusive Nightmarium ore, only on Halloween.

Sinistyte S is an uncommon ore that spawned between 3,000m-4,000m and was initially released on October 22nd, 2020 as part of the 2020 Halloween event. This ore is limited and only comes around every October 1st and lasts for the rest of the month, eventually becoming unobtainable again after Halloween. The ore is based off of an item called 'SpookStorm-X' from another one of Berezaa's games

New To Azure Mines. Azure Mines is a mining game first developed by Berezaa during a five hour live stream on June 7th 2016. You start off with a base in ruins and it's your job to restore it to its former glory by upgrading the stations with ores and gold. You can also go deep into the mines and caves to collect rare ores! 
Azure is the ore featured in the game title. It is found at 1400m-2000m, most commonly around 1450m. It can take a while to mine and gives 25,000 XP upon mining. Azure is used to craft the Azure Pickaxe and upgrade base stations. 286 Azure would go to base station upgrades; 185 to Mining Operation, 10 to Data &amp; Analysis, 25 to Marketplace, and 66 to Research &amp; Development. 1 for level 10 1 for  
The Ore Museum was added during the Nuclear Winter Update, it has two floors and, and when fully completed by the player, showcases every obtainable ore in the game (Excluding Unobtainium, since mining Unobtainium gives the currency, which is uC, instead of the actual ore). The entrance of the museum leads to its first floor. Here, you can find an interactable unnamed NPC sitting at a desk  
Element V is an ore added at the end of the Halloween Event 2021. Like Kappa, it can only be found once per mine, but it is instead found at the coordinates 718, 4439, 252. How to Find Element V without the Navigation Kit: First, deplete your inventory completely. Start at the top right corner, closest to the Ore Museum, and face the direction of the waterfall. Mine down to 16m, and then mine

Sulfur is an ore added in the Halloween Update, which was originally only added for one of the badges of the ROBLOX Hallow's Eve 2017 event. It's a dull yellowish ore that takes little time to mine, and awards 35 XP when mined, making it a good source of XP for starters. Sulfur is one of the most useless non event ore in the game, as only 135 is needed for upgrading the Mining Operation and  
October often is the time of the year where the souls of the fallen are able to roam the world once again. The M in Sinistyte M stands for Master, however “Master” implies that an apprentice exists. This ore exists anywhere in the world, but nowhere has a Sinistyte A been found. However, variations of Sinistyte with the letters Y, L, D, B, S, and P were discovered across the world  
Sinistyte L is an uncommon ore that spawned between 1,000m-3,000m and was initially released on October 22nd, 2020 as a part of the 2020 Halloween event. This ore is limited and only comes around every October 1st and lasts for the rest of the month, eventually becoming unobtainable again after Halloween.

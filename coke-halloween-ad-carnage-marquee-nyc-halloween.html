        <h2><strong>coke halloween ad witch halloween costume</strong></h2>
        <p>This story is about a cheeky Pepsi Halloween ad that directly referenced its biggest competitor, Coca-Cola. On the left, you can see Pepsi’s hilarious Halloween ad from 2013. On the right side, though, there is a Coke fan’s hilarious response. Apparently, the sky is the limit when it comes to Halloween promotions. 
Pepsi tapped into Halloween, a time of year associated with costumes, fun, and a bit of mischief. The timing was perfect, and the holiday backdrop made the ad feel relevant and engaging. It wasn’t just a Pepsi vs. Coke ad—it was a *Halloween* Pepsi vs. Coke ad. 
PepsiCo celebrated Halloween with an ad displaying a can of Pepsi in a red "Cola-Coca" cape. The direct jab at rival Coca-Cola carried the text "We wish you a scary Halloween!" The ad got  
Pepsi Ad Strategy. Directly mentioning a competitor in an advertising campaign can be a bit risky. Although Pepsi avoided any copyright issues with the exchange of “C” and “L” in the Coca-Cola logo. PepsiCo celebrated scary Halloween with advertising displaying a Pepsi can in a red “Cola-Coca” cape. In addition, the direct poke at  
8. Pepsi vs Coca-Cola – We Wish You A Scary Halloween. In the everlasting advertising war between Pepsi and Coca-Cola, there must have been one brilliant ad with the Halloween theme that made this list. Back in 2014, Pepsi released a Halloween ad that displayed a Pepsi can wearing a Coca-Cola cape, titled: “We wish you a scary Halloween”. 
October 31, 2022 November 16, 2022. Food &amp; Drink Seasonal. When Pepsi dressed up as Coca-Cola for Halloween. October 31, 2022 November 16, 2022. Halloween is here, and Pepsi made the most of it. 2013 the drinks giant issued an ad showing a can of Pepsi dressed in shiny red cape, a swirling logo, resembling their rivals’, Coca-Cola. 
As part of Halloween promotions, Pepsi devised a sassy ad directly referencing its most fierce rival company, Coca-Cola. The ad features a Pepsi can or tin enveloped in a red cloak or cape. It sports the misspelled version of Coca-Cola in white (using a play in lettering) that reads as “Cola Coca.”. The backdrop is that of a ravine terrain. 
That’s why for Halloween, Pepsi launched this ironic advertisement campaign, made by the Brussels based agency Buzz in a Box. In this ad campaign, Pepsi can is dressed in a red cape branded with  
This professional campaign titled 'Spooky Halloween' was published in Germany, Norway, and Sweden in October, 2022. It was created for the brands: Coca-Cola and Fanta, by ad agency: Filmic Art. This Experiential, Film, and OOH Outdoor media campaign is related to the Food industry and contains 3 media assets. It was submitted almost 2 years ago. 
This (seemingly unofficial) ad posted to 9Gag strikes back quite brilliantly. Though it doesn’t appear to be an ad that Coke or its agencies created, it’s a pretty cool response. 
It didn’t take long for a response to immerge. However, the response came from a Coca Cola fan, not Coca Cola themselves or any ad agency. The fan’s image text reads, “Everybody wants to be a hero!” Of course, this changes the idea that Pepsi isn’t wearing a “scary” cape for Halloween but is trying to be a hero – like Coca Cola. 
Additionally, regular and zero-sugar variations can be found on Coca‑Cola Freestyle and in frozen dispensers at select locations. In Canada, fans can enjoy the limited-edition Fanta in 500-ml bottles, 12-packs of 355-ml cans and on Coca‑Cola Freestyle (regular and zero sugar).

The ad reached this viral status on social media because the Coca-Cola supporters felt the Pepsi can was improved by wearing a Coca-Cola cloak where the Pepsi side felt the opposite. There was so much talk between the two sides about the “Scary Pepsi” ad that Coca-Cola even gave an unofficial response back.

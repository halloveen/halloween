        <p>Pagan origins. To understand how Souling came to be, we have to go back 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain (pronounced ‘Sow-in’), which was traditionally celebrated on 1st November. Meaning ‘summer’s end’, Samhain represented the changing of the seasons. Samhain marked the end of the harvest and the beginning  
This Halloween, English Heritage is reviving the historical tradition of souling by re-creating soul cakes and handing them out to trick-or-treaters (while supplies last!) who knock at 13 of our sites after hours.

Souling was a Christian practice carried out in many English towns on Halloween and Christmas. Souling is a Christian practice carried out during Allhallowtide and Christmastide, with origins in the medieval era. [4] The custom was popular in England and is still practised to a minor extent in Sheffield and parts of Cheshire during Allhallowtide. 
But it wasn't called trick-or-treating back in the day. It was called souling. It happened around All Souls' Day, a special time where Christians prayed for their loved ones. It carried on through the Victorian era, and people think this is how trick-or-treating became a British tradition. So, what about creepy costumes? 
Mix dry ingredients, rub in fat, drop in egg and vinegar and knead till soft. Roll out 1/4 inch thick then cut into rounds with a big cutter.

Halloween is celebrated every year on 31 October all around the world.  This was known back then as Souling,  Approaching the Victorian era, the food often given was a type of pastry called  
One theory suggests that excessive pranks on Halloween led to the widespread adoption of an organized, community-based trick-or-treating tradition in the 1930s. This trend was abruptly curtailed  
October 22, 2021 In Headlines from History by Rose Staveley-Wadham. Nowadays, we tend to think of Halloween as a thoroughly modern phenomenon, an American Hallmark holiday. But using newspapers from the Victorian era, accessed through The Archive, we will discover in this blog how Halloween is a thoroughly ancient phenomenon. 
Along with the greeting cards came a recognition of Halloween as a yearly event and the holiday took on a life of its own. Most agree that the first reference to “trick or treating” was in a 1927 Albertian newspaper, followed soon by another Canadian reference the day after on November 4, 1927. 
The Victorian era, spanning from the 1830s to the early 1900s, witnessed a fascinating shift in the perception of Halloween. While the holiday’s origins lie in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of harvest and the beginning of winter, Victorian England saw a transformation in how Halloween was celebrated.

Halloween is also known as All Hallows' Eve, All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. Soul Cakes are old English traditional cakes that are usually baked on Halloween.

Samhain's date eventually coincided with the Catholic All Saints' Day, moved from May 13 to November 1 at some point in the eighth century (per Britannica).The hallowed night before All Saints became known as All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween, and the Christian holy day and Celtic festival coalesced by the end of the Middle Ages in the British Isles. 
During this week, the souls of the dead family members were venerated. On this day, families visited the tombs of their ancestors and offered sacred offerings of bread soaked in wine, salt, wheat, flower-garlands and violets petals; all reminiscent of the celebrations of the later “Halloween”. Honour is paid, also, to the grave. 
Halloween's origins can be traced to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Over the centuries, Halloween evolved, taking on Christian influences, European myth and American consumerism. 
This period saw the transformation of Halloween into a community-centered holiday, with masquerade balls and costume parties becoming popular. The masks of this era were often handmade, showcasing the artistic skills and creativity of their makers, setting the stage for the commercial Halloween industry that would emerge in the 20th century. 
5. Victorian Halloween Parties. The Victorians were an energetic and fun-loving bunch, but they were also generally a bit obsessed with death and the supernatural. Their Halloween parties were whimsical but very dark events – in more ways than one. </p>

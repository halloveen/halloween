Christians should take time to inform the consciences of friends and family with biblical truth regarding God, the Bible, sin, Christ, future judgment, and the hope of eternal life in Jesus Christ for the repentant sinner. There are several different ways Christians will engage in Halloween evangelism. Some will adopt a "No Participation" policy. 
Most people in the world have no experience of lasting joy in their lives. We’re on a mission to change that. All of our resources exist to guide you toward everlasting joy in Jesus Christ. October 27, 2016. Trick or Treat?

The answer is complex. As you and your family prepare for Halloween, continue to study, pray, and seek God’s wisdom. Estimated reading time: 11 minutes. Across the world, the month of October ushers in a new season of weather, pumpkin themed foods, and fall celebrations. Also, October means the arrival of an often-celebrated day: Halloween. 
Christian young people should stay away from secular Halloween parties since those are breeding grounds for trouble. Christian parents can protect their children by keeping them well-supervised and restricting treat consumption to those goodies received from trusted sources. Third, Christians should respond to Halloween with gospel compassion. 
This week, well-respected pastor John MacArthur shared a pro-Halloween article by Travis Allen asking his followers what their thoughts were on the holiday. "First, Christians should not respond to Halloween like superstitious pagans," the article stated, "Pagans are superstitious; Christians are enlightened by the truth of God's Word."

Pagans are superstitious; Christians are enlightened by the truth of God’s Word.” {source :: Grace to You – Dr. John MacArthur} 1 John 4:4 reminds us that “Greater is HE that is IN you than he that is in the world.” Though halloween might focus on death and darkness and evil, we don’t have to be afraid or cower in fear. 
John Fullerton MacArthur Jr. (born June 19, 1939) is an American pastor and author who hosts the national Christian radio and television program Grace to You. [1] He has been the pastor of Grace Community Church , a non-denominational church in Sun Valley, California since February 9, 1969. [ 2 ] 
MacArthur's Bible Study Guides MacArthur's Questions &amp; Answers. Note: "After 24 years of association with the Ministry of John MacArthur, we have now been asked by Grace To You to no longer maintain John's resources directly on Bible Bulletin Board. The reason is that all of John's works are now available in totality on their website.

First of all, the title, "Christians and Halloween,"(1) is syncretism. Real Christians and Halloween have as much in common as God and Satan do, but the Grace to You writer links them together. John MacArthur's damage control for Satan via Travis Allen: "First, Christians should not respond to Halloween like superstitious pagans. 
MacArthur, a premillennialist, suggested that Christians who believe they can assist God in establishing His Kingdom by seizing the reins of political power are misguided and often driven by a mistaken postmillennial eschatology that believes Jesus will return following an extended period of Christian political and cultural dominance. 
In Stand Firm: Living in a Post-Christian Culture, Dr. John MacArthur drafts biblical battle plans for maintaining a life of Christian faithfulness. God has revealed what kind of people we are to be in a hostile world, and by His Word and Spirit, He supplies us with everything we need to persevere in holiness, humility, and love. </p>

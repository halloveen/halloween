        <p>Halloween Week is a week-long event that usually occurs at the end of October or the start of November. See main article: Growganoth The main portion of the event is located at the special world GROWGANOTH (GROWGANOTH0 - GROWGANOTH200 are also available). In the world, the player can drop items of rarity into the Maw to obtain different Halloween-themed items. Growganoth also accepts a few  
Growtopia Gazette. October 19th: Halloween Week! It's time to dust off your cobwebs, light your jack-o'-lanterns, and get ready for a hauntingly good time as Halloween has just started! Go trick-or-treating with your fellow Growtopians and gather as many Halloween Candy as you can while showing off your ghastly, gourd-geous costumes! 
Check your backpack. There will be a new Halloween item inside. Things to note: -Halloween items will be added even if you do not have enough backpack slots. -Do not drop a stack of splicable items. This will only yield one item. For example, dropping 1 Dirt will give you 1 Candy Corn, but dropping 200 Dirt will still give 1 Candy Corn. 
Incognito Hat: 1 can be obtained from purchasing the item itself for 150,000 gems in the Growtopia Store. → During October 17, 2024 only! This item's recipe is not yet found or public.

Community content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted. Halloween Week 2021 started on October 21, 2021. Now costs 15,000 Gems each instead of 9,000. Now costs 6,000 Gems each instead of 5,000. No longer available in the store and became a prize by Sacrificing a Dark King's Offering into Growganoth. 
90+ rarity items give Cultist set, worth a fair bit. Also might wanna buy angels far ahead then save until after Halloween when they are much rarer. Many get sacrificed for Devils.

Useful and limited items rise much faster like: Magplant and Rayman Items needed in events like: Angels in halloween or baits in Christmas or chemicals in the zombies outbreak, or farmables for getting the goblin Or sometimes items rise due to price manipulation (owners of buy++ worlds) 
okay so every year, growtopia releases 100 of all of the draconic items (ex : draconic wings, draconic soul parasol and others) yes and on valentine they are dropping very fast (some days before valentine, draconic wings's seller were 88 dls ish, but sellers are 80 dls and the other draconic items were also very cheap rn. okay so why did i  
No. It's too late to invest on rarity 100+ items right now because most of them would drop to 3-5/WL during Halloween. Those include Thingamajigs and Battle trouts, do not buy them! There are people who are probably loading 10-20+ vends with Steam Stomper (rarity 102) and would crash the market for 100+ rarity items.

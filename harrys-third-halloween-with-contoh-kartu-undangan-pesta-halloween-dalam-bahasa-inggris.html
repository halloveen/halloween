Besides wholly abandoning the Michael Myers plotline, Halloween III departs from the slasher film genre which the original Halloween spawned. The focus on a psychopathic killer is replaced by a "mad scientist and witchcraft" theme. Produced on a budget of $2.5 million, Halloween III grossed $14.4 million at the box office in the United States.

The Halloween 2024: The 5 Terrors of Midnight event is, well, a Halloween-based event that lasts for 2 months and 21 days and is the Xth event to be added to Tower Defense Simulator. This event is quite different from the other events, but is somewhat similar to the Halloween 2021 event, as both events boast different types of bosses instead of the normal one boss that the other events had  
The Spooky Skincrate is an exclusive skincrate that was only obtainable during the Halloween 2020 Event from the Halloween Season at Rank 4, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13.

Tower Defense Simulator is a game made by Paradoxum Games created on the 5th of June 2019 and officially released on the 14th of June 2019. It involves players teaming up with one another to fighting waves of different enemies until they either are overrun or triumph that particular map. 
The Lunar Overture Event was the twelfth event to be added to Tower Defense Simulator. This event brought two new event towers and a season pass, which requiredPumpkins to reach higher ranks. This event had three acts, which were three different maps with unique enemies and wave structure, with each act getting harder. The first act was released few hours after the Lunar Overture Update  
Towers are, for the most part, the only way to counter enemies.They are essential to a player's loadout and gameplay. Each tower has its own set of abilities, purchase cost and upgrades associated to that particular tower. 
Waves are the main event in the game that will become more challenging as the game progresses, introducing new enemies. Each mode has a unique set of waves, with some enemies being exclusive to that very mode. As each wave progresses, you get a wave completion reward, which depends on the mode you are playing. Players must make sure enough enemies do not reach the end of the path to reduce the

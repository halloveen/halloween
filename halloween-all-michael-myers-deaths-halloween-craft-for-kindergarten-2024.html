Halloween: All Of Michael Myers’ Deaths, Ranked. By Devin Meenan. Published Oct 24, 2021. Few names are as iconic in the horror world as Michael Myers. Since 1978, Michael Myers has been thrilling and horrifying film audiences in equal measure. The ultimate slasher, Michael may look human, but under that intimidating exterior, he's a soulless  
Published Aug 17, 2020. ScreenRant. Over the past four decades, the Halloween franchise has seen Michael Myers "die" several times. The original 1978 movie—directed and scored by John Carpenter, co-written with producer Debra Hill—starts off telling the story of Michael Myers, who was committed to an asylum for killing his teenage sister on  
It all depends on the Halloween timeline, but in a recent interview with Screen Rant, director John Carpenter finally shed some light on Michael Myers’ seemingly supernatural abilities  
So you can pick your poison here, but both endings aren’t groundbreaking. 7. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) Cause of death: Shot by Haddonfield police force. Yes, it’s true  
5 Halloween (2007) Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween amped up the violence and gore to a whole new level. The film is notable for its attempt to have viewers sympathize with Michael, at least  
The original and still most iconic Michael Myers death fake-out occurs in the franchise's very first film, Halloween (1978). While still a terrifying murderer, Michael is still more of a man than a myth at this point, something which makes it feel perfectly reasonable for audiences to expect Dr. Loomis's six bullets and a tumble off of the balcony to be enough to put down the Haddonfield killer.

After he escaped the fire, Michael went on a murderous rampage, steadily making his way back to his former childhood home. While the movie depicted the deaths of Sondra &amp; Phil, a couple whose home Michael invaded to evade detection, it’s revealed on the news later that 4 people were killed on that street, unfortunate neighbors in the masked Michael Myers’ path at the wrong time. 
8. Halloween: Resurrection (2002) Cause of Death: Killer Burns from Busta Rhymes. Okay, so technically this entry is questionable since there is a post-story tag of Michael Myers’ charred corpse  
The first Halloween film kicks off Halloween night, of course, in 1963. We see a six-year-old Michael Myers murder his older sister with a kitchen knife at 45 Lampkin Lane. 
But even the deaths not committed by Michael Myers in Halloween Kills have a sense of brutality to them. Fans are getting to see Michael Myers at his most enraged, and nobody is off-limits. 
Halloween is an American slasher media franchise that consists of thirteen films, as well as novels, comic books, a video game and other merchandise. The films primarily focus on Michael Myers, who was committed to a sanitarium as a child for the murder of his sister, Judith Myers. 
The 2018 Halloween timeline ignores all sequels after the original and keeps the original plot that Michael Myers was not in any way related to Laurie Strode, and is instead a purely evil serial killer that returns to the home he grew up in to get revenge on Laurie Strode for nearly killing him.

Evil dies tonight! Michael Myers and Laurie Strode are back in the final installment of David Gordon Green's Halloween reboot trilogy – and Halloween Ends has all the scares, shocks, and  
Halloween is a series of slasher films created by John Carpenter and the late Debra Hill in 1978, which is still going to this day. It features Michael Myers stalking and killing people, while surviving injuries that would have been fatal to anyone else. The series splits into five timelines: The 4-6 Timeline, also known as the original timeline, consists of Halloween (1978), Halloween II

        <p>Corpse Bride. A Halloween favorite, this corpse bride look is so good you don’t even need a corresponding costume. UK-based makeup artist Caitlin V. created the look with Do Color’s Space  
11. Pretty Fairy. It’s like a fairy from a science-fiction movie, and that makes it a brilliant idea for pretty and easy Halloween makeup looks. That pink and goldy-yellow glow is easy to recreate with the right shades of makeup and some clever blending, and we especially love those long and dramatic lashes. 
Skeleton. For this creepy Halloween makeup idea, you just need black and white eye shadow or some face paint to draw teeth on your mouth and create dark spots on your face. Follow your own bone

Advertisement. For this look, it's best to begin with the eyes. Using black and gray eyeshadow, blend a dark smoky base, followed up by black liner and falsies. Using the CC Beauty Body Paint Kit, create two red circles around each eye, filling them in with color and being careful not to mess up your black eyeshadow. 
Cruella “The Future” Makeup. the future cruella. If you’re up for a challenge this Halloween, try your take on Emma Stone’s Cruella “The Future” look. This one requires a stencil or steady hand, a lot of black eyeliner or shadow, a bold red lip, and a heck of a lot of patience! 
Some favorite brands (who always crush it on Halloween!) created eerie-sistible makeup tutorials. NYX Professional Makeup. Beetlejuice™. Contour the hollows of the eyes with a shadow stick. Create snakes along the crease using white and black liquid eyeliner. Draw “deathly” -looking veins using black liquid liner. Define lips with a dark  
Halloween is the penultimate holiday for makeup lovers.

And this holds true whether you’re party hopping or getting in character to toss candy to (and maybe terrify  
Spooky Skull. @mollyiles_makeupartist / Instagram. Bones and all, this skull look is delicate yet determined to instill some fear. Paired with glamorous makeup on one side of the face, it gives the ultimate look of Halloween makeup that's pretty and scary all at once. 12 of 27. 
Draw white lines on your lips and under the chin in addition to framing your clavicle bones. Once set, trace that same line with the green pencil, both on top and bottom of the lines, giving it a "halo" effect. Alternate the white lines on your lips with the green pencil, and you're a new type of skeleton. 24 of 37. 
Though these unlikely farm animals helped launch Doja Cat into the limelight, cows aren't often associated with glitz and glam. But Instagrammer @Larachaves_makeup shows that it's possible to be quite the moo-ving vision this Halloween with their elegant cow makeup. And lucky for you, it's easy to grab this look by the horns. 
The next makeup idea is a skull illusion with clown features. This is a cool makeup idea and it combines two classic Halloween costumes. You also have glam eye makeup which also makes the overall look quite pretty and glam. You can check out the products used to create the look on the makeup artist’s page and the link is below.

"American Horror Story" produces amazing binge-watching material for Halloween, and some of the makeup looks on the show are fairly easy to re-create, like the Witch of the Woods from the "Roanoke  
16. Deer Halloween Makeup. Another popular makeup choice for Halloween is a cute deer design like the one featured. The artist has created white spots and a black nose and mouth for the deer look. She has paired it with glam eye makeup. This is an easy and pretty Halloween makeup idea. You can check out the products used on the artist’s page. 
4. Half Skeleton Makeup Idea. Skeletons are a classic Halloween costume and next we have a cool half face Halloween makeup look to show you. For this, the makeup artist has created a spooky skeleton on one side of her face. While the other is glam with blood drips coming from her eyes. This look ticks all the boxes – it’s classic, creepy

41. Bat Halloween Makeup with Scary Contact Lenses. Next, we have a creepy look that is perfect for Halloween. This makeup artist has created a bat design on her face. The look is complete with glam eye makeup, red lips and scary contact lenses. We love this because the bat design is so creative. 
15. Glam Skull Makeup. Our next idea is a skull Halloween makeup, but this one is glam! The skeletal look has been created in a brown tone so it is softer than the black skull makeup. The skeleton makeup has been worn with gems, bold eyes and dark lipstick. We love this idea because it is stunning but kinda scary. 
22. Trendy Makeup Idea. Look trendy this Halloween with makeup like this! The makeup artist has created glam eyes with orange cheeks and an orange nose patch. She has created two tone lips with stitches too. The glam eye makeup and the two lip colors look so stylish and the accessories also add to the look. </p>

        <p>Learn about the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the end of the harvest and the beginning of the dark half of the year. Discover how Samhain evolved into Halloween and how it is celebrated by pagans, Christians and Wiccans today. 
Most American Halloween traditions were inherited from Irish and Scottish immigrants. [6] Folklorists have used the name 'Samhain' to refer to Gaelic 'Halloween' customs until the 19th century. [7] Since the later 20th century Celtic neopagans and Wiccans have observed Samhain, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. [8] 
According to historian Nicholas Rogers, author of Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, Samhain was a “time of stock-taking and perhaps sacrifice” — including probably animal  
It’s easy to look back and say that Christianization was effective. After all, Halloween—All Hallows’ Eve—is now the dominant holiday in the Western world, not Samhain. But upon further reflection, it’s clear that Halloween has become so secularized as to have lost most if not all of its Christian underpinnings. 
7. Prepare a Samhain Feast. On October 31 or just ahead of the holiday, gather friends, family, or coven members to enjoy a feast of seasonal foods. Here are more than 50 Samhain recipes you could try. Some traditional Samhain foods include apples, hazelnuts, and barmbrack (a type of bread with charms). Modern celebrations also include pumpkins. 
19/10/2017. Samhain is a Gaelic festival, which marks the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the “darker half” of the year. This Celtic tradition is still observed by some minorities today. Halloween has its roots in Samhain, but they are not the same thing. Halloween has become a children’s favourite because of the  
Samhain, pronounced sow-in, is the Celtic New Year’s Eve, which marks the end of the harvest. It served as the original Halloween before the church and the candy companies got their hands on it. 
From Samhain to Halloween. When Christianity reached Ireland in the 5th century CE, the Catholic Church found it easier to convert the Celts by incorporating certain pagan celebrations into the Catholic calendar. Attempting to subsume Samhain under a contextually similar Christian holiday, All Saints Day was created and initially assigned to 13  
The folklorist Jack Santino explains the origins of the holiday celebrating thresholds between life and death, and good and evil. Our Halloween traditions are largely traceable to the Celtic day of Samhain, which marked the start of the new year. Santino writes that most of what we know about Samhain comes from Irish sagas written between the  
Samhain (October 31st-November 1st): Marking the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter, Samhain is a time of reflection, honoring ancestors, and the thinning veil between worlds. 2. Yule (Winter Solstice, around December 21st): Celebrating the rebirth of the sun, Yule is a festival of light, joy, and the promise of the returning warmth. 
Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2024 will occur on Thursday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people  
Samhain. Halloween traditions in the West date back thousands of years to the festival of Samhain (pronounced 'Soo-when', 'So-ween' or 'Saw-wen'), the Celtic New Year's festival. The name means "summer's end", and the festival marked the close of the harvest season and the coming of winter. 
Carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and wearing scary costumes are some of the time-honored traditions of Halloween. Yet, the Halloween holiday has its roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced "SAH-win"), a pagan religious celebration to welcome the harvest at the end of summer, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. 
The origins of Halloween can be traced back all the way to the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain – pronounced ‘sow-in’ in Gaelic language. It was originally an event that marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter in Ireland. The day after, on 1 November, would mark the ancient Celts’ new year. 
Samhain, Samhuinn and the Colour Red – Maria reflects on the celebration of the earth’s shedding, dying back and letting go and how it compares to her own life experiences. Tlachtga and the Ancient Roots of Halloween / Samhain / Samhuinn – Luke Eastwood tells the origin story of Samhain. 
De Samhain a Halloween. Con la llegada del cristianismo a las Islas Británicas, se produjo una mezcla y sincretismo de festividades. El Samhain fue adaptado por la Iglesia Católica, fusionándose con otras festividades como la de Todos los Santos (All Hallows' Eve), dando origen a Halloween. 
Halloween, or the ancient Samhain, is considered the time of year when the veil between our world and the spirit world is at its thinnest. As darkness falls and families light their pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, they are, perhaps unknowingly, repeating the ancient traditions of honoring the dead and marking the beginning of the ‘dark half’ of the year. 
Halloween may have developed partially from the pre-Christian holiday Samhain, which was celebrated in early medieval Ireland around November 1 as the beginning of a new year. However, it seems to have developed mostly from Christian feasts of the dead from later in the Middle Ages, including All Saints’ Day on November 1 and All Souls’ Day

Samhain, in ancient Celtic religion, one of the most important and sinister calendar festivals of the year.

        <p>The word “Halloween” comes from All Hallow's Eve. All Hallows Eve is the vigil of All Saints Day —also known as All Hallows Day. The word “hallow” means “holy.” (In the Our Father we pray, “Hallowed be thy name.”) All Saints Day is a Holy Day of Obligation, and thus a major feast on the Catholic Church's liturgical calendar. 
The word “Halloween”—or “Hallowe’en”—comes from All Hallow’s Eve. All Hallows Eve is the vigil celebration of All Saints Day —also known as All Hallows Day. The word “hallow” means “holy.” (In the Our Father we pray, “Hallowed be thy name.”) All Saints Day is a Holy Day of Obligation, and a major feast on the  
Answer: The word Halloween comes from the traditional Catholic feast “All Hallow’s Eve,” referring to the Solemnity of All Saints. Here in the United States, the celebration of Halloween includes trick-or-treating. For more information on Halloween, including its origins, see these various Catholic Answers resources, and also this tract  
Halloween is another word for “All Hallows’ Eve”—the eve of All Saints’ Day. In the old Church calendar, the Vigil of All Saints was a liturgical event. It had its own Mass, where the priest would vest in penitential purple, the usual color for vigils. He would don white in the evening for the First Vespers of All Saints, which marked  
It was not a decision originally from Rome. It wasn’t about Roman pilgrims and it wasn’t about sa. Remember, once you stop believing in Pan Celtic religion, SA is a harvest festival on one island. The idea that the entire calendar has to be changed at a universal observance created to co-opt or rebut, that doesn’t make sense on its face. 
While some people have connected Halloween to earlier pagan celebrations of the new year, Halloween actually has significant Catholic roots. The name itself comes from All Hallow’s Eve – that is, the Vigil of All Saints’ Day, when Catholics remember those who have gone before us to enter our heavenly home. Immediately afterwards, on  
The Triduum of Allhallowtide begins on Halloween on Oct. 31 and concludes with All Souls’ Day on Nov. 2. All Saints’ Day is on Nov. 1. In an episode of EWTN’s “Living Divine Mercy,” Father Chris Alar, MIC, shares the holiday’s historical Catholic roots. 
Halloween can be a fun but sometimes tricky holiday for Christians. While it’s often portrayed as a celebration of spooky things, the real meaning behind it is actually pretty cool—Halloween, or “All Hallows’ Eve,” is rooted in Christian tradition as the vigil for All Saints’ Day, a time to honor those who lived faithfully before us. 
The most straightforward answer is that Halloween is "secular." People who celebrate this day in a religious context generally do not call it Halloween. Also, the common practices associated with Halloween such as costuming and giving of treats are secular celebrations. Jack-o-lanterns themselves came to us through folklore. 
The Origins of Halloween. Most sources trace the pre-Christian roots of Halloween to the Celtic harvest festival known as Samhain, traditionally celebrated on the last day of October into the  
no true christian would EVER follow pagan holidays ok halloween IS a CATHOLIC holiday and so is X=MASS and Easter, you will NEVER find these demonic holidays in the bible for Jesus tells us to have NOTHING to do with these demonic traditions of men and Jesus ONLY followed His FEASTS not the secular worldly holidays for in scripture it says IF

The Catholic church tried to co-opt Halloween. But here's where it really started. 
A co-op can offer classes, clubs, events, and other enrichment activities throughout the school year. Benefits of Joining a Homeschool Co-op. There are several benefits to joining a homeschool co-op group. Taking homeschool co-op classes provides the following: Homeschool students will have the opportunity to: Engage in group learning 
Sharpen your pencils, dust off your books, and get that homeschool co-op turning again. Last year I wrote a post on how to make a homeschool co-op thrive with tips on organizing a co-op. It’s a good post, but even if you put the effort in to organize a co-op without good, structured classes, your co-op will turn into a glorified playgroup. 
Some groups meet all day, but I don’t think that works well in a Catholic co-op, the reason being that everyone always seems to have lots of little siblings that need naps. You just can’t keep toddlers out all day. Our co-op met from 9:30 to 11:30, and it worked really well. Ok, here are some tip for running a thriving homeschool co-op! 
Celebrating Halloween means celebrating the Halloween background in its entirety. For Christians, this is a sensitive topic considering how we are responsible for avoiding offensive acts to God. But, it might be interesting to know that despite Halloween’s infamous dark history lies a colorful Christian celebration.

Halloween was already “ghoulish,” so why not give witches a place on greeting cards? The Halloween card failed (although it has seen a recent resurgence in popularity), but the witches stayed. So, too, in the late 1800s, ill-informed folklorists introduced the jack-o’-lantern. They thought that Halloween was druidic and pagan in origin. 
Halloween itself is a combination of two holidays: All Saints’ Day, which was a Catholic holiday that was moved to Nov. 1 to co-opt the other, Samhain, an old Celtic pagan holiday, said Lisa  </p>

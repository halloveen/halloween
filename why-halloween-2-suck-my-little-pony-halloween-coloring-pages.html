        <p>And also Rick Rosenthal also stated that Carpenter had a huge impact on the direction of Halloween II. For example, Carpenter suggested adding more blood and gore into the film to fit in with the other slashers of the time. Sounds like you need to stop watching Halloween movies, man. 
What annoys you most about 1981 Halloween II? Jamie Lee Curtis' wig. that wig came straight out the bag, shook twice, and plopped on her head. baffling they skimped on the wig when she had quite a bit of screen time. it truly was a crime against humanity. 
The “Halloween” movies’ willingness to take risks, at least early on, is more pronounced in the next installment. The first sequel ends, perhaps hopefully, with the death of Michael Myers  
The original Halloween is a horror classic, but the numerous sequels became critical failures, earning increasingly negative reviews due to their mishandling of Michael Myers and diluting the franchise's premise. Many horror movies are considered to be pivotal works that have helped the genre evolve, but few are looked at with as high esteem as  
It’s not perfect but what sequel is. Because it’s trendy to say it sucks mostly because John Carpenter is treated like a God on this thread for some odd reason. A lot of people think John Carpenter lost his way after his success in the early 80s and they may be right. There is too much romanticizing the new H18. 
Halloween II Review. Halloween II picks up literally where writer/director Rob Zombie's 2007 Halloween reboot left off: Michael Myers shot down by his little sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), while Laurie herself is left battered, bloody and half-crazed by her ordeal. The first third of the sequel pretty much revels in the  
There are some very impressive feats of camera movement and scenework, and the film has some very intense segments that create legitimate tension. However, those are few and far between. Every  
After a disturbing run in with a local Hitchhiker (Edwin Neal), the group swings by the old Franklin house, a family estate now left to the elements. Having run out of gas, Kirk, Pam, then Jerry  
Why Rob Zombie Hated Making His Halloween Movies. The reason Rob Zombie had such a hard time making Halloween and Halloween 2 is that he repeatedly found himself clashing with Dimension Films producers Harvey and Bob Weinstein. This was long before Harvey's scandal brought the brothers down, and they had a reputation for creatively meddling in  
Far bloodier and sillier than its predecessor, Halloween II is a warmed-over retread of Carpenter's classic original. As films go, however, Halloween 2 isn't very good. Really misses the point of

A random Tuesday can be enjoyed more than the 31st of October. As a child, Halloween used to be so exciting; dressing up as our favorite characters, getting candy from teachers at school and spending the night with friends going door to door with the famous “Trick-or-Treat.” As college students, this is now the one day a 
Why the fuck are you acting entitled to free items in a free-to-play game. It's the Halloween update of course they are going to be Halloween only, and you can play custom servers with Halloween mode enabled if it's that bad. Newsflash valve doesn't want to add a shit ton of free hats and costmetics to be able to be sold on the market and traded.

 is beginning to suck. Here are reasons why. 
Halloween 2 (2009) has the opening hospital scene in which Michael looms over everyone in such a terrifying manner that I had nightmares as a 21 year old guy at the time for weeks. I think that was effective stuff. I also think in Halloween 1 (2007), he did a really, really good job for the second mart of the movie. 
im on ep 3 and had to search online why does from series suck. season 1 was bad enough dragged out but the mystery is what makes you want to figure crap out. but this entire series crawls forward at a snails pace so fk this im out. garbage like this is what makes yt recap channels worth it. instead of 20 episodes, they'll recap the entire crap

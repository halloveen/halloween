        <p>Halloween time is back at Disneyland Park, and with it comes Halloween Screams, the nightly fireworks spectacular that takes to the skies above Sleeping Beauty Castle, featuring “The Nightmare Before Christmas” during its 30th anniversary. Keep in mind that the show only includes fireworks on weekends and other select nights. 
Halloween Screams: A Villainous Surprise in the Skies is a Halloween-themed fireworks show that is presented at Disneyland during the seasonal Mickey's Halloween Party event. Based on the similarly-themed, former fireworks show HalloWishes at Magic Kingdom , Halloween Screams is hosted by Jack Skellington and features appearances from Disney  
“Halloween Screams” is back as Disneyland’s fall nighttime spectacular at Sleeping Beauty Castle. The show features Jack Skellington as the “Master of Scare-omonies” and Zero alongside  
Running nightly during Halloween Time — Sept. 2 through Oct. 31, 2022 — this spooky-fun seasonal spectacular is a real treat. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King himself, and very good boy Zero welcome you before ghosts, Disney villains and more take over Sleeping Beauty Castle with projections, lighting and special effects. 
Jack Skellington and his ghost dog, Zero, float above Sleeping Beauty Castle during the projection and special effects show – “Halloween Screams” on the first night of Halloween Time at  
Each night, you will receive a dreadfully delightful treat in the form of “Halloween Screams,” a nighttime spectacular featuring supernatural projections and other ghostly special effects viewable from in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle, “it’s a small world” facade, Rivers of America and along Main Street, U.S.A., in Disneyland park.

Halloween Screams is a can’t miss experience which includes Zero, Jack Skellington’s dog from the Nightmare Before Christmas, flying over Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. This is easily in my top three favorite Disneyland fireworks shows. 
In Disneyland, the light and fireworks show is called Halloween Screams. Jack Skellington greets the crowd and images of Disney villains and ghosts appear on Sleeping Beauty's Castle, all set to a medley of Halloween music. The light show ends with fireworks on selected nights. 
MICKEY'S HALLOWEEN PARTY (ANAHEIM, Calif.) Jack Skellington presides over the Halloween Screams fireworks spectacular, which lights up the sky surrounding Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland park as part of the entertainment exclusive to the annual Mickey's Halloween Party. 
Special Halloween fireworks shows take place at many of the Disney Parks and Resorts. Fireworks on Halloween come from the British tradition of bonfires to "scare off bad spirits", which are usually held on Guy Fawkes Day (November 5) as well as the city of Derry, Ireland where an annual fireworks show takes place as part of the annual festivities. The following are a sample of said shows

Jack Skellington is the protagonist of Tim Burton's 1993 stop-motion Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone film The Nightmare Before Christmas. He is the "Pumpkin King" of Halloween Town. Jack Skellington is the patron spirit of Halloween, portrayed as being on par with Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny within his own holiday. As a living skeleton, he is immortal and can remove parts of his body  
Disneyland Resort has a themed night show called ‘Halloween Screams’. The show features projections of Disney villains on Snow White’s castle and Main Street walls, which is quite phenomenal, along with the music and lights. On select nights, the Halloween Screams show is accompanied by fireworks. Night entertainment during Christmas 
“Halloween Screams” is back as Disneyland’s fall nighttime spectacular at Sleeping Beauty Castle. The show features Jack Skellington as the “Master of Scare-omonies” and Zero alongside Disney villains and more. 
Zero floated over Sleeping Beauty Castle in ‘Halloween Screams’ last night! This new spooky spell-ebration was kicked off by the Pumpkin King himself - Jack Skellington. Catch this ghoulish 
Sleeping Beauty Castle is a fairy tale castle at the center of Disneyland and formerly at Hong Kong Disneyland. It is based on the late-19th century Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany.[1] Opened July 17, 1955, the castle is the oldest of all Disney castles. Its primary inspiration was the Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Though it reaches a height of only 77 feet (23 m), it was  
In this limited release pin The Nightmare Before Christmas' Jack Skellington and Zero float above Sleeping Beauty Castle during the Halloween Screams Nighttime Spectacular found at Disneyland Park. The pin includes Zero as a pin-on-pin element and Jack's head glows in the dark. The background is black. 
It wouldn’t be Halloween time without the giant Mickey jack-o’-lantern in Town Square at Disneyland. More festive fall décor includes jack-o’-lanterns along Main Street, U.S.A. and around the Partners statue in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. 
A must-see during Halloween Time is the special fireworks show, Halloween Screams. This year’s show features projection mapping technology over Sleeping Beauty Castle that will make the fireworks display even more spectacular. </p>

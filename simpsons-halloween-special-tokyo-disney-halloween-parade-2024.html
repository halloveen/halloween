Once upon a midnight dreary, Matt Groening’s “The Simpsons” conjured up a Halloween special with the modest title “Treehouse of Horror.” In the twilight of October 25, 1990, TV lovers  
The Disney+ The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror collection gives you access to all the The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror movies, TV shows &amp; more. 
This article refers to the first episode in the Treehouse of Horror sub-series. For an overview of the sub-series as a whole, see Treehouse of Horror series. Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils.

The Simpsons’ best Halloween special isn’t a special at all and hidden in one of the late seasons. By Nick Valdez. October 20, 2024, 7:58pm. X; Facebook; 20th Television Animation. 
Although some fans argue that The Simpsons is deteriorating as it continues, the nadir of the show’s Halloween offerings was released over a decade ago. "Treehouse of Horror XXII" featured a deeply forgettable Dexter parody that borrowed liberally from the far funnier "The Ned Zone" and a far-too-late Avatar spoof, but neither of these lesser segments is responsible for its ignominious  
The Simpsons this Halloween, and details have been released.

8. "Halloween of Horror" (2015) Maybe this episode is more of an honorable mention, since it's not technically part of the Treehouse series. But considering that it's also one of the best Halloween-themed Simpsons episode of the 21st Century, it really deserves a place here. 
It is also the first Halloween episode to be titled Treehouse of Horror in the opening credits, as all prior Halloween episodes were referred to as The Simpsons Halloween Special. It is the first of these episodes not to have a Roman numeral used in its opening title. </p>

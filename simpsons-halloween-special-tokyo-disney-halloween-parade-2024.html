        <p>As of 2023, there are 34 Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. The 27th season marked the first time two Treehouse of Horror specials were aired, with one episode being a single story ("Halloween of Horror") and another featuring three segments ("Treehouse of Horror XXVI"). [9] The 31st season included a Thanksgiving -themed  
Treehouse of Horror XXXIV: Directed by Mike B. Anderson, Rob Oliver. With Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith. In the thirty-fourth annual Simpsons Halloween special, Bart is turned into an NFT, Lisa turns to Sideshow Bob for help in tracking down a serial killer and an outbreak turns Springfielders into Homers. 
The first Treehouse of Horror installment aired on 1990 as part of the second season, and its on-screen title was "The Simpsons Halloween Special." ("Treehouse of Horror XIII" was the first to feature "Treehouse of Horror" in the on-screen title.) 
The Treehouse of Horror series, formerly known as The Simpsons Halloween Specials, are an annual tradition in which there is a special Halloween episode consisting of three separate, self-contained pieces, which usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting; they always take place outside the normal continuity of the show (and are therefore considered to  
The Simpsons Treehouse Of Horror Episodes. Also known as The Simpsons Halloween specials, is a series of Halloween specials in the animated series The Simpsons (1989), each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the Simpson family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting. 
"Treehouse of Horror", also known as "The Simpsons Halloween Special", is the third episode of season 2 of The Simpsons and the sixteenth episode overall. It is also the first installment in the Treehouse of Horror series and consisted of three parts. It originally aired on October 25, 1990. Part one was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wes Archer, part two was written by Jay Kogen  
3. "Treehouse of Horror V" (1994) All of these episodes are great, and feature iconic "Treehouse of Horror" segments. This is the episode where Groundskeeper Willie gets an axe in the back in all  
Treehouse of Horror XXXI: Directed by Mike B. Anderson, Steven Dean Moore. With Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith. The 31st annual Simpsons Halloween special includes a frightening look at the 2020 election, parodies of Pixar and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and a ninth birthday Lisa just can't get over.

The Simpsons Halloween episodes, more commonly known as Treehouse of Horror series, are an annual tradition in which there is a special Halloween episode consisting of three separate, self-contained pieces.

Treehouse of Horror XXXIII: Directed by Mike B. Anderson, Rob Oliver. With Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith. In the 33rd annual Halloween special, Marge's resentment takes a monstrous form, Lisa tries to save the planet through murder, and Homer realizes that he's not the man he thought he was. 
Once upon a midnight dreary, Matt Groening’s “The Simpsons” conjured up a Halloween special with the modest title “Treehouse of Horror.” In the twilight of October 25, 1990, TV lovers  
The Disney+ The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror collection gives you access to all the The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror movies, TV shows &amp; more. 
This article refers to the first episode in the Treehouse of Horror sub-series. For an overview of the sub-series as a whole, see Treehouse of Horror series. Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils. Oooh, things on TV that are completely not appropriate for younger viewers. Things like  
The Simpsons’ best Halloween special isn’t a special at all and hidden in one of the late seasons. By Nick Valdez. October 20, 2024, 7:58pm. X; Facebook; 20th Television Animation. 
Although some fans argue that The Simpsons is deteriorating as it continues, the nadir of the show’s Halloween offerings was released over a decade ago. "Treehouse of Horror XXII" featured a deeply forgettable Dexter parody that borrowed liberally from the far funnier "The Ned Zone" and a far-too-late Avatar spoof, but neither of these lesser segments is responsible for its ignominious  
The Simpsons this Halloween, and details have been released. According to Variety, the 35th installment of the beloved Simpsons tradition will see a partnership with the team from Stoopid Buddy as they do a Venom-themed special, which is said to be “the scariest 35th Halloween special ever.” Instead of Venom, Homer will come face-to-face  
The episode becomes more insightful with "How to Get Ahead in Dead-vertising," skewering the world of advertising by killing celebrities to use their likenesses for free, which is an eerily prescient segment given current concerns about studios using A.I. Lastly, "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" satirizes the classic Peanuts Halloween special  
8. "Halloween of Horror" (2015) Maybe this episode is more of an honorable mention, since it's not technically part of the Treehouse series. But considering that it's also one of the best Halloween-themed Simpsons episode of the 21st Century, it really deserves a place here. 
It is also the first Halloween episode to be titled Treehouse of Horror in the opening credits, as all prior Halloween episodes were referred to as The Simpsons Halloween Special. It is the first of these episodes not to have a Roman numeral used in its opening title. </p>

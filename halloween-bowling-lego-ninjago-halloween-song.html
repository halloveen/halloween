Instructions. Roll out a small piece of gauze and place your bowling pin on top of the gauze. Start wrapping the gauze tightly around your bowling pin, starting from the bottom, working your way to the top. It just takes a few wraps around the bowling pin to completely cover the pin, and get the oh-so wrapped up look.

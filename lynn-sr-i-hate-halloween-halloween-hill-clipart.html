        <p>The Loud House is covered in Halloween decorations as the entrance of a corn maze sits next to it. Off-screen, a fridge door opens, and a scream is heard, as bats fly out of the house and towards the screen, darkening the picture. Zoom out to a close up of Lynn Sr. screaming in horror after seeing a fake severed head with fake blood in the fridge.]

When Lincoln and Clyde declare their Halloween a complete success by eating half of their last candy bar, Lynn Sr., who fell unconscious, wakes up, relieved that Halloween is finally over, but when Geo arrives, still piloting Marie Antoinette's severed head, Lynn Sr., scared out of his wits again, screams "I hate Halloween!" one last time.

Lynn Sr.:[offscreen] “AAAAAH! I hate Halloween!” Lucy: “Oh.” [everyone looks at her] “Dad must have found the severed limbs I stored in his closet.” [Outside. Lincoln’s head pops out of a pile of leaves as he looks right. A car passes by, as the camera pans with it, stopping at at a trashcan. 
The father of the Loud family wasn't always a dad, or even a Senior! From his childhood summer camp to marrying Rita and having children, here's all of Lynn  
Lynn L. Loud, Sr. is the father of Lincoln Loud and his sisters and the husband of Rita Loud, and a supporting character in The Loud House. He is played by Brian Stepanek, who also voices Todd in the same series. Lynn Loud Sr. is the patriarch of the Loud family and his wife Rita were typically only seen from the neck down, or would have their faces obstructed, the reason being to visually  
"Speaking of the best Halloween ever, we have some pretty big plans, too." He told them while putting his walkie-talkie to his ear, to Clyde. "We copy, McBride of Frankenstein. Meet you at the rendezvous point in fifteen. Over." A thump is heard as Lynn Sr. is heard screaming. "AAAAAH! I hate Halloween!" 
Lynn Sr. opened a new spatula, however in spite of this, Lance took the spatula for himself much to Lynn Sr.'s chargin. After Lynn Sr. accidentally popped Lance's excercise ball, the two Loud brothers got into a heated argument and vowed to never see each other for the following Christmases which led to them faking injuries to avoid seeing each  
We then see Lynn Sr. screaming in horror after seeing a fake severed head with fake blood in the fridge. "I hate Halloween!" he exclaimed, walking away. Lawrence then peeked his head in, and snickered. He then walked over to the fridge and took out the severed head. He sighed. "I love Halloween." He then turned to the camera. 
Halloween doesn’t make up for the other 364 days of shit. Seriously people, don’t move here. It’s crowded, it’s full of idiots, Donald Trump is the president, people still think they’re living in the Cold War, the president said that climate change is a hoax, people dont want free healthcare because they don’t want to spend 75 cents each so a poor person doesn’t die, and the  
Lynn Loud, Sr. (voiced by Brian Stepanek) is the patriarch of the titular family at the heart of The Loud House. Lynn is married to Rita and together they have eleven children including Lynn, Jr. Lynn, Sr. loves his family but can also be stern when he needs to be. He is terrified of spiders. Ly 
I was just going to post an opinion like this, but decided to check the history before posting. Halloween is a seriously shit holiday. In general I hate the commercialism of holidays in the US. It is like holidays are just designed to force people to buy unnecessary shit. But Halloween is the worst of all. 
Lynn Loud Sr. is always cooking up something creative in the kitchen and sometimes they are great and other times not so much. Here are the best and grossest 
8) That ^^ includes creepy costumes and decorations. I hate other people’s Freddy masks, zombie makeup, and f*cking zipper faces. Cut that shit out!

I love those gory type movies, but Halloween is supposed to be fun and spooky, maybe it's because I'm an old fart (M50) give me the ghosts,goblins and witches classic stuff. 
Here is a surprise fan fiction that I wrote for this year's Halloween. I hope you enjoy my 50th fan fiction It was the day before Halloween, and the Loud family were busy setting up the house for the holiday. “This Halloween is going to be amazing,” said Lucy, as everyone was getting the house spooky. -”We have the best looking house on the block,” said Lola. -”No competition  </p>

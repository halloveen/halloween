Now fans are hoping the next installment, Halloween Kills, also by Green, continues this new uptick in quality horror in the name of Michael Myers. The good news is that some of the first reviews of the sequel — filed after its premiere at the Venice Film Festival this week — are favorable. The bad news is that, overall, the reception is  
Rated R, 1 hour 46 minutes. But in this second part of a trilogy spun out of the rebooted property — all set on the same night and slated to conclude with next year’s Halloween Ends — Green  
OK, so we knew there was going to be an ending. We just didn’t know there'd be, like, six endings. Honestly, after a while I stopped keeping count of each time I thought “Halloween Ends,” ballyhooed as the final, no-really-we-mean-it-final installment of the “Halloween” saga that began with John Carpenter’s 1978 classic — or at least for star and producer Jamie Lee Curtis — was  
Halloween Kills picks up moments after Green’s 2018 incarnation ends, with Myers surviving being burnt to a crisp by Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Laurie, bleeding profusely, is being taken  
If it sounds like the script of every other horror movie to come and go at the local movie theater, it’s not. By turns terrifying and funny, “Scream” — written by newcomer David Williamson — is as taut as a thriller, intelligent without being self-congratulatory, and generous in its references to Wes Craven’s competitors in gore.

Yeah, sure, right. Green’s third “Halloween” film opens in surprising fashion: without an immediate focus on iconic, enduring final girl Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, riveting as ever  
Halloween Ends, capping them off, is about closure — to the extent that Laurie Strode and the murder-ridden town of Haddonfield, Illinois, can dare to imagine such a thing. Four years after a

REVIEW: As the cover and opener title card boasts, this is based on a true story that occurred in 1982. The obvious comparison is that it’s a “Halloween” style knock off. But let’s put that aside and concentrate on the film itself. Halloween night actually lives up to a slasher fare offering and does so pretty well. 
What we said: “What tremendous performances from all four; what style [Andrew] Haigh brings to this movie, fusing the themes of romantic relationships and intergenerational relationships of his previous movies Weekend and 45 Years.”

Rated 5/5 Stars • Rated 5 out of 5 stars 09/18/24 Full Review Thomas R It has a lot of scenes I really like, but I find this movie pretty forgettable Rated 2.5/5 Stars • Rated 2.5 out of 5  
Look, Halloween Party is not scary, and as a horror movie, that is a problem. But, the characters are engaging and fun, brought to life by a wonderful cast. Full Review | Original Score: 7/10  
This film muddies its entire concept with a bizarre, unrefined commentary on mob mentality that is quite simply some of the worst material in either Green’s career and the history of this rocky franchise (which is saying something if you’ve seen, say, “Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers”). 
Halloween Review On Halloween night of 1963, a young Michael myers murders his older sister. On Halloween night of 1978 he's escaped, and is heading home towards another (Lee Curtis).

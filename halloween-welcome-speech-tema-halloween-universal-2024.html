        <p>A monologue from Mad Millie by Olivia Briggs.

Spooky Poems For Halloween. Halloween began as a holiday for individuals who practiced the occult. It has since turned into something completely different. Halloween is about the fun of dressing up and pretending to be someone else for a night. Trick-or-treating and children gorging themselves on way too much candy. 
Your guests will expect a welcome speech and they will be pleasantly surprised and grateful if you focus on the quality and not the quantity of your words.. So, prepare a simple, short and effective welcome wish - and then focus on planning all the other great party celebrations - music, excellent food, creative decor, dress code and the theme!

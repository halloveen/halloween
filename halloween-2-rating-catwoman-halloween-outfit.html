Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism. Horror. 92 minutes R 1981. It's a little sad to witness a fall from greatness, and that's what we get in “Halloween II.”. John Carpenter's original 1978 “Halloween” was one of the most. 
Feels pedestrian and uninspired where Halloween felt fresh and terrifying. Full Review | Jun 3, 2019. Shaun Munro Flickering Myth. Far bloodier and sillier than its predecessor, Halloween II is a  
Halloween II: Directed by Rob Zombie. With Sheri Moon Zombie, Chase Wright Vanek, Scout Taylor-Compton, Brad Dourif. Laurie Strode struggles to come to terms with her brother Michael's deadly return to Haddonfield, Illinois; meanwhile, Michael prepares for another reunion with his sister. 
Budget. $15 million [2] Box office. $39.4 million [3] Halloween II (also known as simply H2) is a 2009 American slasher film written, directed, and produced by Rob Zombie.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 48 reviews and a weighted average rating of 4.80/10. The site's critical consensus reads: " Halloween II picks up where its predecessor left off - and quickly wanders into a dead end that the franchise would spend decades struggling to find its way

Plot wise, Halloween II is kind of like another famous sequel, Friday the 13th Part 2. Both feature hulking maniacs. Both have prominent scenes involving a shack of some sort. Both feature the  
The original Halloween II took up the story mere moments after the first movie ended and kept up a hurtling momentum that helped it over the slower or sillier bits. Zombie's meandering new plotline, taking place over a year, just stretches things out and gives you more time to reflect on how none of it makes sense. 
Halloween II is an affront to Halloween and horror fans. It's the kind of cataclysmic misstep from which a franchise cannot recover. It has transformed Michael Myers from an iconic movie monster into a laughingstock. 
A man covered in blood lumbers toward a truck as two men struggle to get in, stabs one man in the back (we hear crunching and squishing) and a woman watches as the man's face slides down the window of the truck and leaves a streak of blood on the glass, the attacker then slices the man's throat (blood gurgles out of the wound, as he gasps and dies), and another man is impaled on antlers  
Halloween II is the sequel to Rob Zombie's 2007 Halloween remake. In the sequel, Laurie Strode contends with the psychological trauma inflicted by her murderous brother, Michael Myers. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is attempting to profit from Laurie's trauma by writing a book about the incident as Michael returns to Haddonfield to continue the hunt  
Parents need to know that Halloween is the horror movie that introduced the world to the infamous killer Michael Myers and has gone on to have a huge influence on the genre. Main character Laurie ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) is smart and resourceful, but the film does play into the cliche of only "good girls" deserving to survive, while rowdier ones

The new Halloween II hammers on a note of gloom from the beginning, and while some of cinematographer Brandon Trost’s intentionally grainy images are visually striking, the overall lack of modulation in tone prevents the movie from building much suspense. Still, one can be thankful that there aren’t more attempts at intentional humor—at  
There is something terribly comforting about watching 'Halloween II' on live broadcast tv with a storm howling outside, watching a camera pretend to be Michael Myers watching nurses come and go, cats leap out of garbage dumpsters, paramedics talk about what pizza they want to eat if they could eat pizza, security guards listening to FFC's 'Dementia' on their scuzzy black&amp;white tv's, watching  
Halloween 2 has its problems, but the all-star cast is doing great work, and the film has a surprisingly nuanced consideration of Final Girl PTSD. Full Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Oct 25, 2023 </p>

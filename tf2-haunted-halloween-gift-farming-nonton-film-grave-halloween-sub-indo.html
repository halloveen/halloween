        <p>TF2 2 Player Halloween Gift Farming. (Resources at Bottom) This guide will show you how to farm for Haunted Halloween Gifts with only 1-2 players in the game. Alright, there's actually 10 "players". It's just that 8-9 of them will be idling accounts. This will cut out all that unwanted competition so you can be free to collect ALL the masks! 
The Haunted Halloween Gift was a special pickup that used to spawn during the Annual Scream Fortress Halloween Events in Mann Manor, Eyeaduct, Ghost Fort, and Helltower. It is a large, lime-green gift box with a bright orange ribbon. The player who collected the gift would receive various items, depending on which map the user was playing on. 
Like in the last year, I have brought my gift farming server back online! It basically teleports you around the map over the known gift locations and to the lava, so you actually "acknowledge" gifts. Commands: !farmon (enables teleporting) | !farmoff (disables it) IP: 92.51.147.73:27095. Location: Central Germany. 
Spells are dropped via the Haunted Halloween Gift, which drops every couple of hours. Spells are only available through these gifts on the map koth_lakeside_event or Ghost Fort. Also known as Merasmus' Lair. These gifts are only obtainable during Halloween. 
Halloween Contracts are Back on October 9th! 🎃👻 It’s that time of year again, folks—Team Fortress 2’s Halloween event is right around the corner! Starting October 9th , the spooky season officially kicks off in TF2, and with it comes the return of the highly anticipated Halloween Contracts. If you’re new to these or just need a refresher, we’ve got you covered. This year’s  
The Haunted Halloween Gift is a special pickup which is spawned during the Annual Scream Fortress Halloween Update in Mann Manor, Eyeaduct, and Ghost Fort. It is a large, lime-green gift box with a bright orange ribbon. The player who collects the gift box on Mann Manor will receive a random Halloween Mask; upon collecting all nine, one can  
A Halloween map, also known as Halloween-themed map, Haunted map, or Event, is any one of a series of Team Fortress 2 maps released specifically for activation during annual Halloween events, during which these maps are hosted by Valve 's Team Fortress 2 servers with Halloween mode activated by Valve in celebration of the Halloween season. 
Oct 23, 2014. #3. Spawning. The Haunted Halloween Gift will spawn at one of many predetermined locations on Mann Manor, Eyeaduct, Helltower and Ghost Fort. When a player receives a gift, they will incur an approximate 48-minute cooldown, during which time they will be unable to find gift boxes. After this cooldown finishes, they will be

The Halloween Gift Cauldron is an action item. It is represented by a gift-wrapped black cauldron with a stylish glowing green bow. When used, the player receives three random Scream Fortress 2014 cosmetic items, with the included possibility of getting a Kritz or Treat Canteen. One of these items is always both Strange and Haunted, whilst the

Haunted is an item quality designated for Halloween-themed items.Many, but not all, Halloween items have a Haunted version. Costume pieces from the Very Scary Halloween Special event could be obtained in Haunted quality if a Haunted Halloween Gift was found in the Underworld section of Eyeaduct, and had a rare chance of being obtained from Halloween Goodie Cauldrons. 
The item granted is randomly selected from a droplist that includes all the cosmetic items previously granted from Haunted Halloween Gifts and Halloween Gift Cauldrons. The droplist also includes one weapon (the Bat Outta Hell) and one action item (the Kritz or Treat Canteen). There is a small chance of the item being of Haunted quality. 
Scream Fortress 2024 or Scream Fortress XVI is the Halloween event that started on October 1, 2024, with the in-game activation of holiday-restricted cosmetics.

Fixed spectators collecting the Haunted Halloween Gift in Mann Manor. October 29, 2010 Patch. Fixed players who are spectating teammates being able to collect the Haunted Halloween Gift in Mann Manor. October 26, 2012 Patch (Spectral Halloween Special) The Haunted Halloween Gift is now only visible to (and can be collected by) one player. 
Last Halloween was the first TF2 Halloween I experienced and I found it AMAZING. I got scared when HHH chased after me, I fought Monoculus and traveled into the underworld, and I brought a ton of Huntsmans and gave them to people so we could kill Merasmus easier, but I was wondering if there are any servers out there that support halloween bosses and their maps 24/7, not just during Halloween. 
There used to be a gift every 5 minutes on every halloween map (during halloween only), available to everyone, but because that made everybody play Scout or something it got changed. So now everyone get a gift once an hour instead. 
This is how they're making it fair. This way, farming gifts is much harder. You only get one gift per merasmission, and the merasmissions are strictly controlled. Even if you use multiple alts, you still have to spend time completing each merasmission, and the gifts you get are untradeable. The only way to get more gifts is by crafting. 
The gifts on Helltower have a long spawn rate, I'd say about 1 gift in 45-60 min. The gift spawn rate in other halloween levels is faster, but you wont get the same items from them. EDIT: in Helltower, each player gets their own gift spawns. unlike the other halloween maps, there is no contest of who finds the gift first. </p>
